2,4,"(excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means., Sometimes I interpret it like they're psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do., So I just stood there like ' remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line?, That's what I looked like., So you didn't ask?, No, I froze., Counter., Oh yeah., So wait, wait., A half-hour later I'm back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story., He says, 'So why don't you call her?'

3,9,"Where'd you meet her?, I met her on an elevator., On an elevator?, You met a woman on an elevator?, Impossible, right?, You got less than sixty seconds., That's like dismantling a time bomb., What got into you?, I don't know., She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex., The words just came out of my mouth., Wow., What'd you say?, You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England., Wow., Can you believe I did that?, What did she say?, What crop circles?, Not a good sign., Not everybody knows what the crop circles are., (to the newsstand owner) Do you know

me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe., Well, her nose is a little big., Yeah, she's got a big nose., I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big., It's a schnoz., Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection., A little., So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose?, I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me., I have no job, nothing., But I have to say, I think about the nose., I don't want to think about the nose., I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it., I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it., I look at her, I see nose., Stop being so concerned with looks., Have you said anything to her about it?, I could never do that., You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place., She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose., And I really like her, I know that., And I know one other thing., I'm not getting past that nose., Alright, shut up, here they come., (waving) How can I not think about it?, Look at the size of this thing., So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me., Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back., And now he's in prison., He got arrested for mail fraud., So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison., Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?, No no, he's never met her., She's in California., Are you coming with me?, Oh, yeah yeah, I have to., I'm your fianc&eacute;, Peter Von Nostrand., Why don't you just commit yourself

Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge., What, you didn't wash all day?, Yeah, I washed, just not the hand., You wouldn't believe the women at this club., Ohh, man., It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York., I actually find it kind of intimidating., Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job., Kramer!, What?, What?, How could you say something like that?!, What?, What do you mean?, I just said she needs a nose job., No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose!, I'm so sorry, Audrey., No, it's ok., What did you have to say that for?, Well, I was just trying to help out., Yeah?, Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr., Von Nozzin., You see what happens when you try to be nice?, Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back., What are you thinking about?, Thinking?, Nothing., What could I possibly be thinking?, You look like you've got something on your mind., Oh, yeah, right.,

think?, About the pizza?, No, about the nose job., Oh, the nose job., I don't know, what did you think?, Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know., Yeah., (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined., And again, I'm not suggesting., I know, they're good., Peter Jennings had one., Really?, Probably., They all do., In my high school, half my graduating class had them., Of course, I'm from Long Island, so..., Uh huh., It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist., I hate the dentist., It's a cleaning., So you really think I should do this?, If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things., I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society., I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life., Well, maybe I should., What the hell., (barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?, Me?, I didn't say anything., You encouraged her to get one., I didn't encourage., No encourage., Peter Jennings had one?, It's possible., Well, I think you should accept her for who she is., No, George is right., I want to get one., I think it's a mistake., Me too, really., Unless you'd really like to get one., I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it., Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes., (checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock., We have time., It's exciting, isn't it?, She's gonna have a whole new face., It is exciting., Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but..., Please, please, Isabel?, She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life., I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time., It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game., And I'm letting him win., You're not letting him win., He wins till you're forty., Then what?, He still wins but it's not a blowout., She wants to be an actress., She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything., So finally Kramer comes in the other day., (holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number., Please, help me., Help me., (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you., So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey., Good for you., I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal., I mean it was just completely uninhibited., It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring., It's not like that at all., How do you even know the jacket is there?, Well I don't, I'm guessing., Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know?, Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began., You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,, George?, Yeah?, Enough., Alright, are we ready?, Come on, let's get this show on the road., Are you sure you want us here for this?, Yes., Shouldn't a doctor do it?, No, he said I could do it., Okay, here goes., Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth., It looks good., Great job., You got butchered., Let's put him over here., (to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?, (with hand covering nose) To the doctor!, Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you., How ya feeling?, Too much salt in my diet., Can I get you anything?, Nah, I'm good., You sure?, Anything?, Mmm, no., Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?, No, it didn't., No, it didn't., It's like, all dented., Seems to be., Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it., You can't stop modern science., Can't stop it, you can't stop it., Can't stop science., Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--, Shut up, George., Shut up?, Yeah., Interesting., Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!, I don't have it, I threw it out., You're lying!, You got it, I want that number!, I told you, I threw it out., Give it to me!, You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise., Well, I changed my mind, I want that number., You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number., I was lying, give it to me!, No, you told me not to!, I want that number!, Alright!, (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah!, Yeah!, Yeah!, (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you!, Look at what you've sunk to!, Look at what you've become!, Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry., You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore., It's turning my stomach!, I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself., It's eating me up inside!, The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum., Over here..., Yeah., You see this perinasal sinus cavity?, Oh, I got it., You see how it's collapsing?, That's what's causing this huge dent., Yeah, phew., So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?, What?, Remember we talked about taking a trip together?, We did?, Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?, Hawaii?, Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this., (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around., Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous., I never heard that., Oh yeah., My friend lived there., We could go to the Caribbean., You know, I have to tell you something., You couldn't get me on a plane right now., I get those FAA reports directly., My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so., Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing., It's in the offing., But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going., You could go., I don't mind., George, I don't think this is working., Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed., I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore., I'm Nelson!, That's not the line, Jerry., Alright, alright, I'm sorry., (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time., I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you., Well, you just need to relax., Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun., Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly., (to himself: Uh oh., My organs are playing chess again., Well I'm getting a little tired of this., What do you say we play one for all the marbles?, Oh Brain, what are you doing?, You cannot beat me., Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?, Forget about it!, I can't take her anymore., I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes., Oh, so what?, So you read from a little play., You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy?, You're so selfish., Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night., What about tomorrow morning?, Do you have any idea what that's like for me?, Do you care?, No, you don't care., So long as you get to do whatever it is you do., You disgust me., Oh, go read a book., Enough chatting, let's play., You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital., (filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?, Yeah., Wait wait wait wait wait., (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here., What do I need this for?, Because we're engaged., We're engaged?, Um hm., Kramer, this is too big., (lighting his pipe) It's my mom's., Hello?, Oh, uh, hi., I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter., My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him., Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you., (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?, Yes, yes I am., I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it., Uh, yes., Well, it's, uh, very intriguing., Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?, My contention?, Yes, your contention., Yes, that's my contention., I heard him contend that., It's too bad about your father., Oh, it was a frame-up., A fine man, he spoke often of you., He's very proud of the work you're doing., Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing., She does fine work., Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case., The closet's this way., How kind of you., You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe., What's the matter, fella?, You look a little tired., Ha ha ha ha ha!, Nelson, don't you see?, You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you., It's killing me., (Makes a move), That's your move?, Yeah., Well that's trouble, my friend., That's big trouble., Checkmate!, (beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me., I'll be back., You're nothing without me., Nothing!, (before disappearing himself) Punk., Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working., Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe., He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies., My father, really?, I had no idea., Yes, they're crazy about him., There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor., Could have been your mother., What was her name again?, Carter?, Kramer!, That's it, Babs, You don't say?, I found it!, The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can., Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, 'Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!', So I grabbed the guy by the collar., Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer!, Kramer, you're killing him!', So I assume the jig was up., Yeah, pretty much., Hi., Hi!, Hey., (to George) Hello., (smitten) Audrey?, My god, you look incredible!, I can't believe it!, (motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor., He was wonderful., So, will I see you later tonight?, Not sure., (rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later., (To Audrey) Ready?, (holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash., Neither did I., We're off to the Reggae Lounge., (after they leave) Isn't she beautiful?, Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face., She's breathtaking!, Who would have though she's like--, (interrupting) Elaine., Shut up."

fully recovered., He told me he was just using me for sex., Let me get that., No no no, I got it., Please., No come on, let me, let me., I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,, (sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it., What are you doing here?, I got fired from the movie., Get out of here, why?, Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered., Aww., Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody., He started crying., And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off., Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.'

front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman., The reclusive Mr., O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government., He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler., Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist., There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport., Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily., Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight., Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio., Something's very strange., George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry., They come back

first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like., Who?, The head of the Aryan Union;, O'Brien., What's taking him so long out there?, Didja see the way she was looking at me?, She's a Nazi, George., A Nazi!, I know, I know., Kind of a cute Nazi though., Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?, I don't know., Let's just make a run for it., I can't run, I have a bad hamstring., How'd that happen?, I hurt it in a hotel room., You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms?, I can't sleep like that so I tried to

1., She said she'd do anything., Hello, police?, Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--, --Astroturf?, You know who's responsible for that, don't you?!, The Jews!, Ah, the Jews hate

is no joke., O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien?, That's not funny., Oh my god., Yes., Yes!, What is it?, Don't you see?, There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized., Do I have to spell it out for you?, The limo?, The name?, The rally at Madison Square Garden?, Jerry, O'Brien are the same person., Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!, Jerry's a nazi?!, I can't believe I didn't see it., Listen, you idiot!, Just calm down!, I know Jerry, he's not a nazi., You don't think so., No, he's just neat., You know it's funny., You don't look like an O'Brien., Me??, And you really don't look like a Murphy., I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy., He's extremely Murphy., He's Murphy to a fault., Where are you from?, Dublin., Originally., Parents came over here when I was eighteen., Cereal famine., Couldn't get a bowl anywhere., Bad., 'Tis a beautiful country though;, lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat., Sounds more like Scottish., We were right on the border., Maybe he's with the company., What?, The CIA!, Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within., What about his comedy act?, That's the perfect cover!, All that time on the road?, Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian., These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people., What about George?, What about him, he's part of it., His whole personality is a disguise., No real person can act the way he does., Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization., They're all part of it., He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd., George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!, I'll bet they were even in on it., Alright, what are we gonna do?, I'm not gonna let him hurt you., (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna., Kramer, you're hurting me!, Those are my friends I was telling you about., We're gonna talk to them, pull over., Get off of me!!, O'Brien., Let's get him!!, What do I do?!, What do I do?!, Get in the car!, Get in the car!, (pointing to Jerry) O'Brien., Long time no see., How's tricks, Murphy?, Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?, No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed., It could be very confusing., Yeah?, Eva?, It's for me., (takes phone) Hello?, (cups receiver) It's O'Brien., O'Brien?, Well that's weird., (gun drawn) Who are you?, A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene., They are banging on the car, trying to flip it

to be a whopping 375., What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen., In another development, Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor, Lloyd Braun, who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco., We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement., It's hard to understand., Because I've been doing everything I

(Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris., (chuckling) Is that a coincidence?, (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps), So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?, (pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards., So where's he taking you?, Well first we're going to a matin&eacute;e, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go

with it), (annoyed) Good for the tuna., Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you., So what?, What am I supposed to do?, Go talk to her., Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who

You know those?, Oh yeah: HA-A-A, HA-A-A., Yeah., Hate the big coarse 'ha.' Hate those., And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man., I see., So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here., Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again., Can't be done, huh?, The Switch?, 'The Switch.', Can't be done., I wonder., Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch?, In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!, They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages., Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together., The point is I intend to undertake this., And I'll do it with or without you., So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now!, And I'll go on my own., If not, you can get on board and we can get to work!, Now what's it going to be?, All right, dammit, I'm in., I couldn't do it without you., All right., Let's get to work., All right., That's enough for today., You're

stupid idea to begin with!, Let's face it., I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!, We'll come up with something., Yeah, sure we will., All right., See you tomorrow., (George sighs, exits.), I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!, All right., Let's go over it again, one more time., All right., So I tell Sandy that I want to have a m&eacute;nage &agrave;, trois with her and her roommate., That's right., And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect., Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises., Keep going., At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events., Continue., The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request., A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work., Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered., Huh., Well, it all sounds pretty good., There's only one flaw in it: They're roommates., She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back., She's not gonna do that., You disappoint me, my friend., Sandy wants nothing to do with you., She tells Laura, 'If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem.', It's a perfect plan., So inspired., So devious., Yet so simple., (George, finger in the peanut butter jar): This is what I do., Can I help you?, Uh, no, I'm OK., Well then what are you doing with that racquet?, Um, it's mine., Miss., Landis borrowed it., Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no

whole thing blew up in my face., Ah, that's a shame., Hey, what happened with Sandy., I forgot all about it., Did you call her?, Yeah, I did., In fact I went over there., So what happened?, She throw you out?, Eh?, No actually, she took it pretty well., So what happened?, She's into it., Into what?, The manage., And not only that., She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too., That's unbelievable., Oh, it's a scene man., Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?, What are you talking about?, I'm not goin' to do it., You're not goin to do it?, What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?, I can't., I'm not an orgy guy., Are you crazy?, This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident., Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy?, It changes everything., I'd have to dress different., I'd have to act different., I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting., I'd have to get new friends., I'd have to get orgy friends., ... Naw, I'm not ready for it., If only something like that could happen to me., Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either., I know., Hey, what happened?, Did you get your racquet?, No, I got caught., What do you mean you got caught?, Her assistant caught me., And now I'm probably not going to get a job., He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office., I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet., Meanwhile Mr., Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon., Hey., Hi Cosmo., Hi Cosmo, Thanks man., Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?, Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation., Went to Baltimore., Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?, Yeah, Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet., Just for today., All right all right., Come on I'll take you over to Newman's, Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night., She hung me out to dry., She quit., It would have been nice if someone told me about it., I just think you could have said something., That's all., Don't talk to me George, talk to her., Well where is she?, I don't know., Ma!, Cosmo!, We din, we didn't ... ...

you ticket.,  What?,  That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.,  Why?,  You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West?, Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.,  You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?,  Obviously.,  You're crazy.,  Well, what happened when you got upstairs?,  As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave., I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.,  Yeah, well I don't trust this guy., I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.,  Hey.,  Hey., What are you doing?,  I'm watching your door.,  My door?,   Yeah, from my peephole., Fisheye, sees all., (still outside)  What was that?,  Newman!, (fleeing to the bedroom)  Damn!, (after entering)  The bedroom!,  I see you, Newman!, I see you!,  I'm taking the Congo as a

later it would peel right off., It was the worst gift I ever got., (visibly upset)  Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work., The way you

Kramer, he is an innocent primate., So am I., What about my feelings?, Don't my feelings count for anything?, Oh, only the poor monkey's important., Everything has to be done for the monkey!, Look,

don't think she heard me., You know, left ear?, What?, Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear., What, you didn't know that?, Oh my god., What?, She probably never heard it., Don't you see what this means?, It's like the whole thing never happened., It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!, Are you gonna say it again?, That's the question, Jimmy., I'm gonna do it., What?, After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again., I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!, What's going on?, He's gonna talk into her other ear., Oh., Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you., What happened at the funeral?, Now, did you talk to Alec berg?, Yeah, I saw him., Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?, Well, not exactly., He's mad, isn't he?, See, I knew it., I don't know if he's mad., Alright, so what happened when you saw him?, Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral., Uh huh., See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'., See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!, Look, what do you want me to do?, I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!, No., No, I can't!, Jerry, this is the way society functions., Aren't you a part of society?, Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!, Look, we got five hours before the game., I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'., He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go., There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets., You stubborn, stupid, silly man!, Hey, great dip., You made this?, No, it's

to talk., Alright, that's cool., David, I don't think we should see each other anymore., You gotta be kidding, how come?, Well, you see, David, you're a face painter., Yeah, that's right., Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting., Well, alright, so you don't like the face painting, I just won't paint it anymore., Yeah, but you like the face painting., Well, I don't need to do it., It's not like a habit or anything., Oh., You mean you'd stop it for me?, Yeah, that's right., That's so, that's so sweet., Ah, c'mere., (They kiss) Alright, I gotta go home and get changed before the game., I'll be back, we'll make out., Siena, I love you., Yeah, I know., I heard you the first time., Yeah., Just

problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry., I apologize., Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it., I mean, who's kidding who?, But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok?, So no hard feelings?, What is that?,

Sorry?, Are you kidding?, You did me the biggest favor of my life., I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions., Suing?, What for?, The coffee was too hot., It's supposed to be hot., Not THAT hot.,

know, let's call her Elaine, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George., She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first., She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating., His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference., But that is a subject for another sermon., Now, I'd like to close with a psalm."

nickel Kramer., Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury., He would have weeded you out., Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious., Oh I can be quite litigious., What I mean who ever heard of this anyway?, Suing a company because there coffee is too hot?, Coffee is supposed to be hot., Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty., (Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty., Hey Maestro!, Ah,

you something., When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?, No., See, didn't bother Susan either., That's why I'm different., I can sense the slightest human suffering., Are you sensing anything right now?, Let me just say this., It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day., Why shouldn't he have a chair?, Well, what about criminal activity?, He's got to be alert., What, he can't jump out of the chair?, How long does that take?, Here look at this., (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch., (stands up) Criminals., Boom., I'm up., (pretends he's shooting) Stop It!, Stop It!, Stop It!, Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down., Would you get out of here., Who's gonna

preferred to be called Maestro., Excuse me?, Well, ya know I am a conductor., Yeah, so?, Oh I suppose it's O.K., for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic., So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't., Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations., I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny., I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations., I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said 'Hello Maestro, how about a beer'., O.K., So that's a fact., Maestro huh?, O.K., (laughing), Jerry!, Jerry!, Jerry!, Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area)., What do you mean?, Well I put that Chinese balm on

obviously a very well proportioned individual., I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?, Nope., Would you like a chair?, I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down., Ah ha, Ah ha., You would, wouldn't you?, Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking., That's exactly my point., Well who wouldn't?, Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down., (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure., Call me crazy., You put the balm on?, Who told you to put the balm on?, I didn't tell you to put the balm on., Why'd you put the balm on?, You haven't even been to see the doctor., If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on., I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?, Your damn right you screwed up., Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?, The Maestro., The who?, What are you talking about Maestro?, My friend he's a conductor., Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?, Well my stomach was burning., I tell you what this is., This is a public humiliation., Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work., Do you know what a balm is?, Have you ever seen a balm?, Didn't you read the instructions?, Well I ..., (interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do., They're unpredictable., I'm sorry Jackie., (To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it., (Motions with his head) Yeah, get over., Did you have a good time?, Yeah, he's very interesting., Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'., (Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus., Really?, So what about the 'Maestro' stuff., Did he make you call him Maestro., Yeah, I called him Maestro., You didn't mind?, Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it., O.K., from now on I want you to call me 'Jerry the Great'., I am not calling you 'Jerry the Great'., Why not you call him Maestro., He is a Maestro., Well, I'm great., So you say., What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?, Yeah., (bragging) I'm invited., You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent., As if he doesn't want anyone else there., Why?, I don't know., Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans., Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there., In all of Tuscany?, I wonder., I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it., How do we know how severe the burns are?, Why don't we have him examined by a doctor., Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better., This thing gets into the paper it will kill us., All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores., (Answering secretary) Yes?, Mr., Chiles and Mr., Kramer are here., Send them in., Gentleman., Gentleman come in., Now we don't want to take up much of your time., Let's make this short and sweet., We're prepared to offer you all the free coffee you want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe, Plus.., (Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!, I'll take it?, Who told you to take it?, Did I tell you to take it?, No., I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there., Well I thought we were lucky to get anything., Free coffee?, Yeah., I don't want free coffee., It's not hard to get coffee., I can get my own, Well I didn't hear any Plus., 20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this., Look, Java World., (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here., I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte., Hey., Hi Maestro., Beethoven's 7th., Yeah., Hey you know we were just talking about you., Oh yeah?, Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?, You didn't find one, did you?, No., I'm not really looking., Nor should you., So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?, The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard., I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?, It's booked solid!, It's BOOKED Jerry!, How'd you get yours?, Got lucky., Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some Verdi., Maybe I'll check out

rent., Huh., Your renting a house in Tuscany?, No., So what do you care?, I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany., Of course he is., There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany., Do you know how big Tuscany is?, I have no idea., It it's huge., It's probably like North Dakota., Oh, no way it's that big., It's a big region., Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?, I don't know why I bother even talking to you., Hey, no one's got a gun to your head., All right., So I spoke to the security guard., Yeah and?, Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit., So are you gonna get him a chair?, Yup., It's really just a question of what kind., Thinking about a bar stool., Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out., With a back or without., Oh I think I'd go for the back., Swivel?, I suppose he could swivel., Hey maybe one of those director's chairs., What do you think of those., I

never heard you., (prods Morty's back) I told you he didn't hear you., Ah, he's deaf anyway., Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three votes against impeachment, and one undecided., Who's that?, Mrs Choate., Who's she?, Oh, that one., She's been a member of the board longer than anybody., She's very tough to deal with., Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and

together?, What is the difference?, Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync., Hmm?, Okay., Now, why do I have to see (points) you?, Ah!, Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me., (dismissive) It's no good., (pointedly) Okay., Fine., What?, I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion., Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here., This is a give and take process., I thought that my suggestion was good., And, I think you could've been a little more tactful., (explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look., We've never worked together on a lie., Now, you don't understand how I work., I have a certain way of working., Jerry and I have worked together a few times., He knows how I work., It's not a personal

this?, What?, (pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation., I don't have a boyfriend., (still pleased) She doesn't know that., We

importer., Just imports?, No exports?, (getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter., Okay?, Okay., So, I'm dating Art Vandelay., What is the problem we're discussing?, (thoughtful) Yes., Yes., (sighs) Yi-yi-yi., Ah!, (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this?, How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing., And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?, (irked) Oh, what?, You don't like that suggestion either?, It's very complicated., (definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in., You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid., Right?, What're you doing?, Are you making coffee?, Yeah., Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too., Morty, you're

They'll steal anything., They're like savages., Yeah, there's some sickos out there., (peering at Jerry) You look very familiar., Have we ever met?, You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?, Maybe you've seen him on television., Jerry's a comedian., Naw, I don't watch TV., (opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you., Jerry, don't go., Ah, I think I'll go., So, Morty, what's this all about?, What d'you

she was dating anyone., Yeah, yeah., She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay., So what does he do?, He's an importer-exporter., What kind of problems are they having?, (not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing., And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing., Are you having an affair with Elaine?, (trying to laugh it off) Right., C'mon!, I'm having an affair with Elaine?!, If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine., I would make up some

couch) we'll wait., (pointedly) But it's unheard of., ...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word., I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which

Because he's my butler., (eager) So?, What d'you think?, Ah., You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler., No., That's what makes it such a humorous situation., Are you following any of this?, I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges., Oh, I, uh, I disagree., You've, uh, you've been living in America too long., (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges., Again with the oranges, (flexing his

How could you know?, (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh., Shh., Shh., It's not important., What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship., ...I didn't say that, no., You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!, Well, I'm sorry., I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it., Hey, hey!, I'm with someone., Oh., Hello., No, I understand., This could be a tough thing to deal with., The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive., (to Mickey) You know?, She's right., Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner., I got gonorrhea from a tractor., You got gonorrhea from a tractor??, And you call *that* your tractor story??, You can't get it from that., But I did., My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit., (walking out) Alright, that's it for me., You've been great., Goodnight everybody., Would you

us the finger., Oh, all right., Yeah., So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg., Oh, yeah., What's that called?, Blimp: The Hindenburg Story., How was it?, I found it morose., Why dwell on these negative themes?, Yeah., They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it., Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, 'That's gotta hurt!', Heh., The place went nuts., Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster., Yeah., Why are we slowing down?, What is that music?, What's with all these flags?, Oh, no., It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!, Ohh!, Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue., They never let anyone through., We're never getting home., All right., I'm gonna check it out., Aiee., mucho trafico., Puerto Rican Day parade.], Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked., I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here., Well, it is our day., Whoo., Wrong car., Sorry., And the Mets score two in the eighth inning., See?, If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs., I could have had some ice cream., I think that might have calmed down the nachos., I'm going to miss 60 Minutes., You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes., It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down., I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking., It makes me anxious., All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out., I think we can get out over there., But that's a one-way street coming this way., Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?, Just inch over., You worm your way., Just do it, Jerry., Uhh., This exhaust., I'm gonna throw up., You know, you should make yourself throw up., Huh?, You know you're going to., All right, I'm worming., Hey, Jerry., You know who the grand marshal is of this thing?, None other than Miss Chita Rivera., They're not letting me in., My hand is out., Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand., They have to see a human face., You sure you want his face?, No, no, no., It was Mar&iacute;a Conchita Alonso., This guy's giving me the stare-ahead., The stare-ahead., I hate that., I use it all the time., Look at me!, I am man!, I am you!, All right, he's letting you in., Thank you!, Creep., Oh!, I know who it is., Stacy Keach., One more lane to go., All right!, We're here!, Oh, look who's here., My old buddy, black Saab., Maroon Golf., Where you goin', black Saab?, You seem to be a tad askew., Could you move your car back a little?, Oh., Sorry., I seem to have cut you off., All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else., You can't do that., You can't just leave the group., I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years., Vaya con dios., Con dios?, Well, that's rude., Can you believe her?, Yeah., I'll see you later., Where are you going?, The movies., Blimp is playing right there., You're going to that again?, Why?, Just to do that stupid line?, It's a performance, Jerry., Like what you do., That's not what I do., Isn't it?, Maybe a little., Ah, hell, I guess it is., You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while., Taxis stuck in traffic]., Look at that guy's dog., I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that., Why doesn't he fix it?, Hey!, Fold your dog's ear back!, Ooh!, This isn't moving!, I could walk faster than this., No, you can't., Yes, I can., Here., I'm outta here., Oh, now it's moving., Oh, yeah., I knew it., Hey!, Hey!, Where to?, That's cute., That's really cute., Oh!, Come on!, All right., Bye again., Hey., Taxi!, Taxi!, Ladies., I, uh, I haven't seen this before., Gimme a box of those and one of those., Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?, The laser's not funny., I'm funny., Yeah., The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try., Uh-huh., It's right in the explosion scene., So if you could just...leave me a little window., You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser., All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so..., I've gotta see this game., If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here., This traffic's a killer, ain't it?, You want to get outta here?, Here's what we do., We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away., Walk away?, You've got insurance., You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free., Isn't there a deductible?, All right, what is your deductible?, I don't know., Yes, because they've already deducted it., From what?, The car, which we're leaving., So the net is zero., See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car., We're not leaving the car!, All right., If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf., Absolutely not., He sped up., Swung on, line hard toward left center field., That's in the gap, that's a base hit., I'm ready to talk., That's gotta hurt!, It's...gotta hurt!, Hurt!, Because...Aaarrrrrgh!, Damn you, laser guy!, You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick!, You're just a prop comic!, Where's the craft?!, Ok, here's the deal., He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an 'I am sorry' wave., What's that?, You raise the hand, lower the head-- 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry., The buttons are really big on the car., I don't understand it., I haven't read the manual., Ooh!' You get my drift., Ok!, Hallelujah., Praise the lord., But I'll take it., Yes!, All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now., All right., At last, we're finally gettin' out of here., What's that on your forehead?, It's probably chocolate., Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?, Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd., It's a George laserium!, All right, stop it!, Stay away from my breasts!, Chest!, See ya around maroon Golf., And, by the way, that was an 'I'm not sorry' wave., What was that?, I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules!, So long, jackass!, Elaine?!, Jerry?!, Jackass?, So I'm a jackass now?, So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this., All right, on the count of three., Can everyone hear me?, Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?, Buenos dias, my friend., Not you!, The guy in the Amigo., Uh, well, uh, here--here is good., Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here., But you knew the way to go!, You went to college!, Hey, I went to Tufts!, That was my safety school!, So don't talk to me about hardship., Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?, Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?!, We were almost out!, So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in., That's real good., I'm not his girlfriend., Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore., Elaine, he doesn't need-, Used to date?, So I guess you found out he's a jackass., 'Cause that's what's gonna happen., Wow., He's givin' you a mustache., Where is this guy?, Don't look around., Don't look around., That's what he wants., All right., Well, I'll see ya., Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya., This thing can't hurt me, can it?, I mean, it is a laser., What if it hits my eye?, I don't know., I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous., You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star., Tchoo!, I

Father?, None of us saw the nylon flap., That might mean something., Oh, all right, all right!, All right!, Come on., Come on., Let's go., Let's go., But it's dark!, Get in there!, Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment., Yes!, Come in, come in., Ok., I'm Christine Nyhart., Oh., Delicious to meet you., Did the broker send you over?, Uh, yes, most likely, yes., I'm, uh, H.E., Pennypacker., I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist., And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with., (sniffing wall) Mmm., Mombassa, hmm?, The asking price is $1.5 million., Oh, I spend that much on after shave., Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day., Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?, No., How about a bathroom?, It has 4., Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?, Just down the hall., Oh, thank you., Oh, don't worry., We'll get you home to your husband real soon., I'm not married., Well, I, for one, really respect that., Oh, thank you., Hey!, Guess who's not married., Is the boyfriend still in the picture?, Come on, father, you can make it., No, I can't., I've got a bad hip., Go on without me., No!, I won't!, Leave me!, you must., All right., Take it easy., All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy., I heard that!, You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible., Still haven't., Ho ho!, What seems to be the problem, officer?, They're for protection, Jerry., Can you tell where I'm lookin'?, At me?, No., Oh., It's back., Bring it on, baby, What if it gets in the side?, The side?, Yeah., Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-, All right!, Oh., It's in your eye now., Hola, Jerry!, I'm into this Puerto Rican day!, The sights!, The sounds!, The hot, spicy flavor of it all!, It's caliente, Jerry!, Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!, Yeah, I know!, I was watchin' the game., You were watchin'?, Where?, Oh, that was a strike!, Did you see that?!, Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--, Eh...Varnsen., Kel Varnsen., Actually, this room intrigues me., Why is it called the TV room?, Well, it's--, Balk?!, How was that a balk?!, You have any snacks?, Mr., Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist., Not Pennypacker!, You know him?, I wish I didn't., Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war., But this time, advantage Varnsen!, Wait a second., I think I see where that laser guy is., No!, Don't look!, Don't look., Oh, yeah, that's him., Ok., I'm gonna sneak up on him., Now the hunted becomes the hunter., We should be able to get across right through here!, It's a dead end!, Oh, no!, I thought--, You thought?!, We're gonna die in the dark!, I knew it!, I knew it!, We're gonna die!, Get a hold of yourself!, Oh, come on!, Sorry., Somebody...help us!, !Mira!, !Mira!, Stacy Keach!, We're down here!, Help!, There's people down there!, Hold on!, Let us out., There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here., Don't judge me!, Help us up so we can cross the street?, Nah, nah, You can't cross here., There's a parade., But we've come so far., We just want to unwind., Hey, what can I tell ya?, Wanna make out some more?, Oh, god!, Let us out!, That wasn't a laser pen., No., It's just a pen., Oh, that's funny, No., You have, like, a dot on your face., Whoever's doing that is very clever., Come on, man., You need to lighten up., You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year., Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico., See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?, Ooh!, !Dios mio!, Hey!, There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!, Who!, Who is burning the flag?!, Oh, no., Him?!, That's not very nice., It was an accident., Do you know what day this is?, Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!, Because it's Puerto Rican day., Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag!, What do you think of that?, Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys., Mama!, Right this way, Mr., Vandelay., Well, this is a lovely apartment., Lovely!, My kids are gonna go crazy., I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms., Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?, It's down the hall., Oh, hello..., Art., Mr., Vandelay, of course., You two know each other?, Mr., Pennypacker!, Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello., Mr., Pennypacker, this is Mr., Vandelay, And you know Mr., Varnsen, Uh, Varnsen., Pennypacker., Vandelay., Pennypacker., Varnsen., Vandelay., Wait a second., Mr., Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr., Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?, The factory?, The Saab factory?, Jerry, that's in Sweden., My car!, Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico., Jerry, the Mets lost., I love a parade!, How do you suppose they did that?, Well...there's no logical explanation., All right., Well, shall we go home?, Well, what about my car?, Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now., Hey, there's Elaine., Hey., Well, you look, uh...relaxed., Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind., Hey, black Saab., Looks like that building cut you off!, Ha ha ha!, See ya around!, Well, at least he didn't-, Jackass!, Somebody remember where we parked., This was a fun day., It's nice to get out."
9,23,"[Jerry and George at Monks] I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"I know what you mean. Do ya? It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again. Same thing! Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you. Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?  What do you think? You want to give him the catsup? It's up to you.  You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time. So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies? Nah - what for? To see a movie. I've been to the movies. Not this movie. They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it. Did you shower today? Yeah. That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered. When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes! Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health. Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.  All right, we're done. You can have it now. Oh, very gracious. [Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk. Kramer and Elaine drive up.] Nice day Yeah. What is that? Hey! JoJo! Ey, ey! All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer. No, thank you. So what are you doing? Nothing. Come on, let's go to the beach. What are you crazy? What? It's a beautiful day. Have a good time. Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air. You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster? Yeah, there's something in the air. [Kramer drives off] Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back. Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone? What? No good? Faux pas. Faux pas? Big hefty stinking faux pas. Why? You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make. It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish. It's dismissive. It's pompous. Why don't you think before you do something? Here's a thought - Bye bye. [Exit Elaine] Too much? [Jerry and George enter Jerry's apartment] Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that. Hey - hey - hey! What? Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend. You're so uptight. Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party. [Jerry listens to his answering machine] Phone Tape: Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks. Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough. Who's he? He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."Our show, "Jerry"? Right. "Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"? Yeah! When? Today, like right now. Right now? "Jerry"? "Jerry"! He wants to talk about "Jerry"? He wants to talk about "Jerry"! "Jerry"! "Jerry"! Can I go like this? Sure! No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets. Forget the sports jacket. I won't feel like a writer. You're not a writer. Right! [Jerry and George are sitting in a waiting room at NBC] Water. Need some water! Water here! Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time. Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes. Don't blow this. I will not blow this. If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts. It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing. He might not want nothing. Something, nothing, I could care less. He might want a show about anything and everything. Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down! All right.  Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you Magic time. What? [Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office]  Mr. Kimbrough. Hey, Jerry, good to see you. Hey, hey, hey! How you been? Good, good. You remember George. George, good to see you. Hello Stu. You remember Jay Crespi. Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi? This is James Kimbrough. Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in. Kimbrough. Don't spell. K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H That's right. It's a talent I have. Why don't we sit down, glad you're here. Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp. Shut up, George. Can I get you anything? What do we have in the fruit department? Oy. Pineapple. Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things. Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old. Been there, done that. Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers. Water coolers? We call it a water-cooler show. Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right? See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines. Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles. But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point. Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, "Jerry", that he developed five years ago. I have always loved it. He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out. He totally flipped out. What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy. He's a little off the wall. Oh yeah. Kramer. And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two. Definitely. I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about. Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that? Or we could get them together. Woo! [George and Jerry attempt a hug outside Mr. Kimbrough's office] Yeah! Yeah! [Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news] Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello? Hi. Elaine, it's me. Jerry, I'm on the other line. No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone. I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency? The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California! That's the emergency? Did you hear what I said? I was on the other line talking to Jill. Jill? Well, why didn't you say so? You said it was an emergency. So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk. [Jerry is telling his parents the good news about Jerry] Congratulations, they're doing the show. They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six. She's not six-six. Jerry, you ever watch that? Yeah, it's pretty good. [George is telling his parents the news.] They picked up the show? I'm moving to California. Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you. The NBC guy liked it? Of course he liked it. He told you he liked it? He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it. Well, what are you doing? I'm writing. You know how to write? Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good. Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything. Ma?! I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas? Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence! I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing. Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me. [Jerry is on the phone with his agent, Kramer walks in.] NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye. Oh hey! Hey - how was the beach? Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing? You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear. So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California! You're moving to California? Yeah, only for a while. Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back. No, I'll be back. Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore. And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California. Fling! [The group is sitting at their table at Monks] So we can go anywhere we want? Anywhere. Why are they doing this? I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years. This is all very exciting. So? Where are we going? I say Japan. Why Japan? Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking. Oh - I got it - how about Russia? Russia, it's so bleak. It's not bleak - it's springtime. It's still bleak. You can't be bleak in spring. You can be bleak in spring. If you're bleak, you're bleak. What about Switzerland? Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh? It's a bit hilly - no? You're not going to do any walking. What if I want to walk around a little? So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up. What if I'm at the bottom? All right! You know what, just forget it! Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris? I'll go to Paris. Me too. Oh yeah - oui oui. So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.  Yeah! [Elaine walks into Jerry's apartment] Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go. Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation. Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane? First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call? All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris. [Knock at the door. Jerry answers.] Hello, Jerry. Hello, Newman. What gives? I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris? Yeah, that's right. Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French. Really. Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker. That's a shame. Take me! Take me! Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man! All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down. [The group arrives by limo to the airport] Ah, Jerry? Yeah. I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris? All set. We'll just grab the bags. Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you. Just keeps on getting better and better. [Our heroes enter the plane] Not bad. Wow! The only way to fly. This is it? [After take-off, the group chit-chats] I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer. You're complaining about a private jet? You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets? Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore. Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one. Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip. This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough. You're not writing any letters! Will you turn around? Why? You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate. It's effeminate to sit like this? Yes, I think it's a little effeminate. How is this effeminate? I don't know - it just is. Kramer, what are you doing? Still got water in your ear? Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain. Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane. I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore. Kramer, don't be fooling around up here. Kramer! Hey, get the hell out of here! What is that? Oh my God! What is that noise? What is that noise? Kramer, what the hell did you do? I lost my balance. Oh my God! What's going on? Kramer! It was an accident. I told you to stop with the hopping. Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die! Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful. Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this. I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah! Jerry? Jerry can you hear me? Yeah. There's something I have to tell you. What? What is it? I cheated in the contest. What? What? The contest - I cheated. Why? Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you. Great - I won. Jerry, I gotta tell you something too. Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you. No no - me first. Alright. Jerry, I've always loved ..u.. Hey - What's going on? We're straightening out! We're straightening out? We're straightening out! We're straightening out!  Yeah! [Outside the plane] Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems. Where are we? Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready. Okay. Okay. We'll see you later. [In front of a store, in Latham, Massachusetts] Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane? I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight. I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane. Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class. First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane. Alright, I'll feel him out. Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up. Nice day. Another one? [A carjacking takes place in front of the group] Alright fatso, out of the car. I want to capture this. Come on! Gimme your wallet. Don't shoot. Well, there goes the money for the lipo. See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya! He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food. I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on. That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC. Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything! Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane. All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out. Forget it. No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville. All right, hold it right there. What? You're under arrest. Under arrest? What for? Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code. What? No, no - we didn't do anything. That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so. I never heard of that. It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go. [In a cell, at the Latham County Jail] The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy? Why would we want to help somebody? I know. That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for. The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people. Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is. Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country. All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here. Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison. What? Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show. California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer. [Lawyer Jackie Chiles' office] Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on. [The phone rings] Jerry Seinfeld on the phone. You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away. So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? Uh huh. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything."
9,24,"[The four are in prison, having a meal] Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh? Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup. I guess we could've called for help. But then we would have missed the whole thing. I still had it on video. We could have watched it later. Yeah, he's right. I forgot about the video. Sure - the video. [Jerry's beeper starts beeping] What is that? Plane's ready. [Rivera Live news show] Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane- Yes. Good evening, Geraldo. What's the mood? What's going on tonight? Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town. And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up? Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote "There's no love lost with that group."Anything else, Jane? There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly. Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married. [Jerry's parents are packing] I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks. What's all that? Cereal. You're packing cereal? I'm bringing it for Jerry. You got enough here for a life sentence. He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything. So bring a snack-pack. [George's parents are packing] Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault. Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that. Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours. You were the one who smothered him. I did not smother him. You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating! Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis. I had to make a living! [Newman, laughing, leaves his building with a suitcase. Uncle Leo leaves with his bags, followed by J. Peterman, David Puddy in his 8-ball jacket, Mickey, Kenny Bania, Mr. and Mrs. Ross, Mr. Bookman, Keith Hernandez, and George Steinbrenner.] [The four are at a table. Jerry and Kramer are enjoying some cereal, while they wait for Jackie Chiles.] This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last. You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment. I bet. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. [Enter Jackie Chiles] Good morning. Good morning, Jackie. Good morning. Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan? It makes me look older. Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed. [Jerry laughs] Do you think it's funny? No. You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase. How do I look, Jackie? Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady. Thank you, Jackie. How bout me, Jackie? Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that. [Jackie hands Jerry a tie] Here. This one? That's right. Do I have to? Jackie says put it on, Jerry. [Court is starting] All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding. Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay? Vanda who? Jerry, did you hear that? Yeah. I think that's a good sign. Is the District Attorney ready to proceed? We are, Your Honor. Mr. Hoyt. Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay. [Newman shown eating popcorn] Mr. Chiles. I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them. Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness? We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand. Call Matt Vogel. So they were just standing there? Yes. Did one of them have a video camera? Yes. Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A. Proceed. [The tape plays] Don't shoot. Well, there goes the money for the lipo. See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya! He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food. [ the victim of the robbery] So they just stood there and did nothing? Yeah, nothing. Nothing! No further questions. [Enter NBC executives Stu Chermak and Jay Crespi] Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed! Call Mabel Choate to the stand. Call Mabel Choate. Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential. Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years. Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness. Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th. Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man. Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld. What did he want? My marble rye. Your marble rye? I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no. And then you left the bakery. That's right. But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate? Oh no. [Scene from past episode, "The Rye"] Gimme that rye. Stop it. I want that rye lady. Help - someone help. Shut up, you old bag! [Back to the present] No further questions. I call Marla Penny to the stand. Call Marla Penny. The virgin! And what was your connection to the defendants? I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992. Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened. It's rather difficult to talk about. It's alright. Take your time. Well, I became aware of a - A what? A, uh - Yes? A contest. Contest? Yes. What was the nature of the contest? Oh please, I can't. It's okay. The four of them made a wager to see if they could - Yes? To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves. For the love of God! It was horrible, horrible! Call Donald Sanger to the stand. Who the hell is that? Come on Donald, you're doing fine. The Bubble Boy! Bubble Boy? That's right, the Bubble Boy. What's a Bubble Boy? He's a boy who lives in a bubble. What the hell are all you looking at? So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992. Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit. [Scene from past episode, "The Bubble Boy"] Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century? That's a joke - the Moors. Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops. Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint. Sorry, the card says Moops. It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops. It's Moops. Moors! Moops! Help! Someone! There's no Moops, you idiot. Stop it! Let go of him! Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it. [Back to the court] It was Moops. Moors. [ the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in "The Handicapped Spot"] So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed? That's right. And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair? That's right. [Scene showing lady screaming going out of control down hill in her wheelchair.] [ Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died] So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died? Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it. So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was? I would describe it as restrained jubilation. Murderer! He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic! Order in this court! Call Sidra Holland to the stand. Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her? So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993? Yes. And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club? Yes, that's true. Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting. We were in the sauna, making chit-chat. [Scene from past episode, "The Implant"] You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie. Oh, hi, I'm Elaine. [Back in the courtroom] So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts? Yes. Why would she do something like that? Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real. [ Joe Bookman, library cop] State your name. Bookman, Joe Bookman. And what's your occupation? I'm a library cop. What does a library cop do? We chase down library delinquents. Anyone in this room ever delinquent? Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld. How long was his book overdue? 25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long. What do you call them? Criminals. [ George's old girlfriend] So you and Mr. Costanza were dating. Yes. And then what happened? Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and - [Scene from past episode, "The Fire"] Fire! Get out of the way! [Back to the courtroom] [ parking lot security guard] At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall. [Scene from past episode, "The Parking Garage"] Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law. I don't know. Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why. [Back to the courtroom] Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom! Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990. Sit down, Mr. Chiles. [ Police Detective] Alright, Detective, then what happened? We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot. [Scene from past episode, "The Wig Master"] You just cost me some money. Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it. Police officers - freeze right there! [Back to the courtroom] So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp. [ the low-talker] So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show? [Mumble] Excuse me? Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on. [ George Steinbrenner] Call George Steinbrenner to the stand. Call George Steinbrenner. So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994? Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie? Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir. He had one little problem though. What was that? He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak. How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?! Order! [ Man from "The Little Jerry"] Cock fighting? Cock fighting. [ Pharmacist from "The Sponge"] Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them. [ Elaine's old boyfriend] She exposed her nipple. [ Mr. Pitt from "The Diplomat's Club"] How did she try to kill you? She tried to smother me with a pillow. Call Yev Kassem to the stand. Call Yev Kassem. Who? The Soup Nazi! Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody. State your name. Yev Kassem. Could you spell that? No! Next question. How do you know the defendants? They used to come to my restaurant. [Scene from past episode, "The Soup Nazi"] Medium turkey chili. Medium crab bisque. I didn't get any bread. Just forget it. Let it go. Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread. You want bread? Yes, please. Three dollars! What? No soup for you! [Back in the courtroom] But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back. [Back to the "Soup Nazi" episode] Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery. That's my recipe for wild mushroom. You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! [Back in the courtroom] She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business! Soup's not all that good anyway. What did you say?! The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand. How did they find Babu? I thought he was deported. You came a long way to be here today, haven't you? Yes, all the way from Pakistan. And what's your connection to the defendant? I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But nobody came! There were no people. And then what happened? Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me, just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice. Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad! Very, very, very bad! [Rivera Live] Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane - Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape. That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery. Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months. Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury? That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night. And so we wait. [The group, waiting for the jury to decide] Do they make you wear uniforms in prison? I think so. It's not that bright orange one is it? I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange. Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face? [George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay] Sorry to bother you, Judge. How did you get in here? Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy. This is highly irregular. Well, maybe there's something I can do for you. What do you mean? You know [Witnesses waiting in pool hall, at restaurant, etc. Mr. Ross buys a gun.] [Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles are in bed] Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate. We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days. [Phone rings] Hello? Damn. They're ready. [Back in the courtroom] Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down? I've always loved ... United Airlines. [Jury reenters the courtroom] I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me. Maybe because she knows you're going to jail. All rise. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference? We find the defendants - guilty. Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned. [Exit Judge Vandelay] You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane. Puddy, don't wait for me. Alright. We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic. Come on, Jackie. Let's go. What? Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular. [The group, walking back to the holding cell] Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle. Why don't you just blow it out your... [They enter the cell] If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones? Sure. Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls. I think that would be a very nice gesture. I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief. See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. Really? Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land. Haven't we had this conversation before? You think? I think we have. Yeah, maybe we have. [Epilogue, on stage in the prison] So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D? I am. I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir? Murder one. Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for? Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes. You suck - I'm gonna cut you. Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand. Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on. Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria."
