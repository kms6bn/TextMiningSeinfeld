Hell perk up. (panicking) Right I knew I felt something! Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced. nan Well look at this guy. Look hes got everything hes got detergents sprays fabric softeners. This is not his first load. I need a break Jerry you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped... And you didnt even hear how she sounded. What?! Laura. I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS! Yeah but how could you be so sure? Cause its signals Jerry its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you what you were doin tomorrow night if you were busy? No. She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night! Yeah. What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at you cant call her. Thats a signal Jerry thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal! Maybe youre right. Maybe Im right? Of course Im right. This is insane. You know I dont even know where shes staying! She shes not gonna call me this is unbelievable. I know I know. Listen your stuff has to be done by now why dont you just see if its dry? No no no dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working it it knows what its doing. Just let it finish. Youre gonna overdry it. You you cant overdry. Why not? Same as you cant overwet. You see once something is wet its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again youre already dead. You cant overdie you cant overdry. (to the other laundry patrons) Any questions? How could she not tell me where she was staying? nan Look at that. Theyre done! nan Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know its dark theres bubbles happening theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear Cmon babe lets go. You come by you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives theyre in the shoes with stinky feet the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before Tomorrow the dryer Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean come on you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first. nan (answering quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game dont say anything I taped it hello. Yeah no Im sorry you have the wrong number.

Hey Im sorry I- you know I I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat? Meat? I dont I dont know go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway? (from the refrigerator) What happened? Well they STUNK thats what happened! You know I almost wound up going to that game. (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You havent been out of the building in ten years! Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say Do you mind?) Are you done with this? No. When youre done let me know. Yeah yeah...you can have it tomorrow. I thought I wasnt allowed to be in here this weekend. No its okay now that that girl is not comin. Uh I misread the whole thing. You want me to talk to her? I dont think so. Oh I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. That close huh? You better believe it. Hello...Oh hi Laura. Oh give me it...let me talk to her. (to the phone) No believe me Im always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me... (to the TV) SLIDE! Wow! No its its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No dont be silly go ahead and ask... Yeah sure... Okay great no no its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! nan If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first easy now drop it down...drop it down your ends got to come down. You know I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too? Look its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous. All right all right one more time one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request? All right she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room... A decent hotel-room... Yeah a decent hotel-room would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place. You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal Jerry this is the signal! nan (cynical) This is the signal? Thank you Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday? I think I was affected by the caffeine. nan Ho ho ho good dog good dog... Hey he really likes you George. Well thats flattering. nan Oh hes gettin a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl? Yeah. Why even give her an option? This is a person I like its not How to score on spring break. Right can we go? Cause Im double-parked Im gonna get a ticket. Yeah okay. Oh wait a second. Oh I forgot to clean the bathroom. So what? Thats good. Now how could that be good? Because filth is good. Whaddaya think rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They have a woman comin over Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always ALWAYS do the opposite. This is how you operate? Yeah I wish. Let me just wipe the sink. Why even give her an option for? nan (to George pointing at the mattress) Its unbelievable. Yeah. Hows the real estate-business? (feeling awkward) Its uh not bad its comin along. Why? Did you need something. Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate? Well I might be getting into that. (slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted! Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go! The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world its a world of tension its a world of pain...and you know if a woman comes over to my house I gotta get that bathroom ready cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it I know that- You know what they need women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls were all human beings what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one I never needed one Ive never been in a situation when I thought to myself: I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two they need thousands of them they need bags theyre like peat moss bags have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later theyre out theyre gone the the bag is empty where are the cotton-balls ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket theres two or three that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured interrogated I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them I took them out I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well Bill the boss thinks youre the man for the position why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with? Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking? What a world that would be if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin. You know instead Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues the whole thing is a murder investigation. Listen listen dont get worked up cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane. Really? How? Cause its all in the greeting. nan Uh-huh. All right if she puts the bags down before she greets you thats a good sign. Right. You know anything in the in the lip area is good. Lip area. You know a hug: definitely good. Hug is definitely good. Sure. Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching the hips are eight feet apart? Thats so brutal I hate that. You know how they do that? Thats why you know a shake is bad. Shake is bad but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom the hand on the top the warm look in the eyes? Hand sandwich. Right. I see well thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. nan Guess who? Hey hey. Heeeey! Its good to see you. Hi. This is my friend George. Hi how nice to meet you. Hi how are you? This is Laura. Laura sure. (to Laura) I cant believe youre here. Ooh yeah the bags sure. nan Oh thank you. (aside to George) Now that was an interesting greeting did you notice that George? Yes the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual I dont know. So uh what do you think? Ooohhh wow! This place isnt so bad. Yeah it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh can I get you anything? Uuhhh bread water...salad-dressing? (laughs) Actually um do you have any wine? Uh yeah I think I do. (referring to a lamp) Oh do you mind if I turn this down? Uh no yeah go right ahead. Uh Jerry uh I was wandering would it be possible  and if its not fine  for me to stay here tomorrow night too? Uh yeah yeah sure why dont you stay? Yeah uhm...What is your what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you are you doin anything? No Id love to do something. Uh I have my seminar in the morning then after that Im right open. Really? What would you like to do? Well... now I know this sounds touristy but Id just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan. (unenthusiastic) Yeah we could do that...why not why not. (pouring the wine) Im just Im really glad youre here. (answering) Yeah hello...yes...yes she is hold on. (to Laura) Um its for you. (to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great right on time... No I Im gonna stay here tomorrow...yes yes its fine... No were goin on a boat ride... Dont be silly... Im not gonna have this conversation... Look Ill call you tomorrow... Okay bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged. (not excited) Youre engaged? You you really have no idea what its like until you actually do it. And Im on this emotional roller coaster. Youre engaged? nan You know I cant believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of we. Ugh its a very stressful situation. (matter-of-factly) Youre engaged. nan Yeah yeah hes a great guy... Yeah. Youd really like him you know I cant wait to get on that boat. Me too! I swear I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it okay? I I I admit I Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women theyre so subtle their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle we are obvious. Women know what men want men know what men want what do we want? We want women thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh we dont know bout that we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks. E-eeehh eehhh eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is that we still get women dont we? Men I mean men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are we have a man working on the situation right now. Now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why I think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like: Where to meet men? Were here we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.]
1,1,1,[So Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them her total was eight dollars the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the... Cheque. Cheque. Now the fact is if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques yknow cause they write out so many cheques. The keys they can never find in their purse they dont know where that is but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that to a man is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man a cheque is like a note from your mother that says I dont have any money but if youll contact these people Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all? Whats that one? Coccoon II: The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there. Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Yknow Maureen Stapleton if she gets a craving shes probably screamin at those aliens I gotta have a lo mein! Okay whatre we doing here? I have seen everything. Oh yeah? I dont believe youve seen... this. Oh lovely. Yeah. What do you think their parents think? So uh whats your son doing now Dr. Stevens? Oh hes a public fornicator. Yes hes a fine boy...

No never mind... Well what is it? Well a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no. Wait a second wait a second. We could work out a little deal here. What little deal? I will go to that if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday. A wedding? Have you lost it man? Yknow my parents are coming in for this... Theyre coming in? Yeah tomorrow. Hey did your father ever get that hair weave? No no. Still doin the big sweep across. Why does he do that? Doesnt think anyone can tell. So cmon do we have a deal? A wedding? Theres a lot of people to mock... All right what the hell. Great! When youre dead youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere... Cmon lets go... Was I supposed to bring something? You could have. I met her one time... It is not necessary. What did you say then? Sssshhhhhh!!! Hi Hi Pamela you remember Jerry. (shakes Jerrys hand) Yes we met. Hi happy birthday. Thanks ah everybody this is Elaine and Jerry. Hi I didnt bring anything. Uh I put you two right here.

What do we have here? Why dont you relax and take your jacket off? Oh I cant. Uh I have a tendency to get chilly. How masculine. Plus Im wearing short sleeves I dont want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) Shes unbelievable! (to Vanessa) Hey this guy says he knows Bricker. Oh you know Bricker! From where? (thinking) Whats going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend shes too good to be alone. Whats the difference I cant maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me. (to Jerry) How do you know Pamela? Uh friend of a friend. And you? We went to law school together. (interrupting Jerrys conversation) Oh Jerry! (turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no not now. I had this dream last night and you were in it. Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God I gotta get out of this. You were you but you werent you... No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please make her stop! I think I think we were in my house where I grew up and you were standing there you were looking out the window... (thinking) This is brutal. You turned around and you had these wooden teeth. How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No I cant I cant. Im stuck. (noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me? Yes I heard you. Elaine whats the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time? (thinking) Thank you Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So youre a lawyer... Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppenheim and Taft. (thinking) Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit. Oh that was you? Imagine spelling Mom with two Os. Very funny! What do you do? Comedian. Really? That explains it. (thinking; quickly) Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppenheim and Taft. Are you ready? We gotta run. Happy birthday! (thinking) I cant believe it. I got nothing! I dont even know her name! Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman Bennet Robbins Oppen... Sagman... Sag... That wasnt so bad really. Yknow um you could use a little work on your manners. Why? What did I do? Wel-Well I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses like Im selling you aluminum siding. I was listening! No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation. No you were talking about the the um the dream you had. Uh-huh... Where you had uh wooden teeth. No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth you did! All right so I had wooden teeth so what? So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh) Apparently Plato who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said Yeah I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea my name callin it after myself. What I do is I go out with the girls I talk with them- dont do anything and go right home. Whatd you think? I think its going to be big! I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them but it didnt work. Yknow I bet you there were guys who tried to do it just went Uh Hi uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey its a Riconic relationship. Hey! Ah there he is! This is what I like see? You come home and your parents are in your bed! Yknow Jerry we dont have to do this. What are you talkin about? Its fine I love having you here. Tomorrow well go to a hotel. Ma will you stop? No why should we take over your apartment? I dont care. Im sleeping next door. Your friend Kramer doesnt mind? No hes making a bouillabaisse. So dad lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices? Depends on the firm. Yeah but if you called up and described someone do you think they would know who it was? Whats the matter? You need a lawyer? No I met someone at this party and I know where she works but I dont know her name. So why dont you ask someone who was at the party? Nah the only one I could ask is Elaine and I cant ask her. Why not? Because its complicated. Theres some tension there. He used to go with her. Which one is she? From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didnt like. Oh yeah very alert. Warm person. Oh yeah shes great. So how come nothing materialized there? Well its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno... I know what it was. You dont know what it was. So what was it? Well we fight a lot for some reason. Oh well... And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry. Well I think shes a very attractive girl. Oh she is she absolutely is. I can see if there was a weight problem... No its not that. It wasnt all one-sided. You know you cant be so particular. Nobodys perfect. I know I know... Yknow Jerry its a good thing I wasnt so particular. (hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So whore you looking for Sophia Loren? Thats got nothin to do with it. How about Loni Anderson? Where do you get Loni Anderson? Why whats wrong with Loni Anderson? I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson. What are you two talking about? Look Elaine just wasnt the one. And this other ones the one? I dunno maybe... So ask Elaine there for her number. I cant. Shell get upset. I never talk about other women with her especially this one tonight. How could you still see her if your not interested? Were friends. Doesnt sound like youre friends to me. If you were friends youd-youd ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works? Oh yeah. Well go up to the office. Up to her office? Go to the building. She goes out to lunch doesnt she? I guess. So you stand in the lobby by the elevator and wait for her to come down for lunch. You mean stakeout the lobby? Morty thats ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number! He doesnt want to ask Elaine for the number. So youve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her? He pretends he bumped into her! Yknow what? This is not that bad an idea. What does she look like? I dunno. Hard to say. What actress does she remind you of? Loni Anderson. Loni Anderson?! What theres something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it. Yeah sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street.

Thats terrific! No we just met... Doesnt matter. Whats the young mans name? I would like to meet him. Hmmm I dont think so. Well what does he do? Is he an artisan a craftsman a labourer of some sort? Wall street. Ah high finance. Bulls Bears people from Conneticut. And he happens to be pretty good lookin. (pause) All right sir. And... hes hilarious. Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy? I staked out his health club. Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout do you find its better to stand up against the wall or kinda crouch down behind a big plant? Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone or lets say especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because you know each other so well you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians trying to entertain each other. The one goes Look a rabbit. The other goes So? I believe this is your card. Look why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night okay?]
2,1,2,[Is that it? Got the cue tips got the mini-umbrella something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done! (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen. (proudly) I am...the master packer. (laughs) Yeah right youre the master packer. What you must understand Elaine (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks. (raising her hand) Scuse me master packer... Yes. Just gimme your keys. All right sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George? (from the intercom) Yeah. Okay so now is there anything else I need to know about this place? Uh yeah the uh hot water takes a little while to come on. So the best thing to do is to turn it on do all your shopping you come back and take a shower. Okay this is quite a place. Theres more. The refrigerator. Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat no leftovers no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear? Ill eat out. One more thing Benes regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited but if you absolutely must do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub. (to Jerry) Ready? Yeah one sec. Hey Elaine. Hi. Coming to the airport with us? No Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate. Oh the actress-waitress? No the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing God I hope I get it I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her... So just kick her out. Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me. Yeah well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you my friend may be in luck. Im not looking. No no no this ones different. This ones a beauty! Yeah whats it like? I havent seen it yet but its a two-bedroom its on the uh west 83rd bout a half block from the park? How much? Uh twice what youre payin here but its a great building. Its two bedrooms! Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that. You oughta at least take a look at it. Really? Why? Cause then I could move in here. Ohhhh... Its time you got outta here anyway. Yeah tell im. But quickly Im double parked here. Listen Jerry this place is falling apart. You have no hot water you cant have soft cheese... Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off. Jerry come on youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this. Like this? You just said you wanted to live here. Well for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland. Jerry what do you you wanna you wanna see the place or not? I cant think about it now. Come on Im going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend. Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down sits down on the couch picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room searching for the TV.) ELAINE! (from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry oh hi welcome back. How were the shows? Great I had fun. Wheres the TV wheres the VCR? What? They were stolen. Stolen? When? A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over. Stolen? (looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open. (to Kramer) You left the door open?! Uh Jer well you know I was cookin and I I uh I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back! Wait you left the lock open or the door open? (guiltily) The door. The door? You left the door open? Yeah well I was gonna bring the spatula right back. Yeah and? Well I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful. So the door was wide open? Wide open! (to Elaine) And where were you? I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up. Look Jerry Im sorry Im uh- you have insurance right buddy? No. (shocked) How can you not have insurance? Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!! Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it Im on the case buddy Im on the case. Yeah dont investigate dont pay me back it was an accident. (theatrical) I made a mistake. These things happen. Im human. In your way. Lets see thats one TV a stereo one leather jacket a VCR and a computer...is that bout it? Answering machine. (disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls. What do you mean? Its a joke. I see. Well mister Seinfeld uh well look into it and uh well let you know if we uh you know if we find anything. You ever find anything? No. Well thanks anyway. You bet. I didnt get that joke either. The crook has the machine. The messages arent for him. Hes the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here? Again? I dont know how you put up with this. Yeah tell im George. (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here? Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent. (to George) Is that uh other apartment still available? I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now the first couple a times you go through it its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself you know you watch TV you think Yeah Im calling the police. Stakeouts manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right you think that. So the police come over to your house they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now unless they give the crook his copy I dont really think were gonna crack this case do you? Its not like Batman where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him hes a PENGUIN! Oh well come on. This is an apartment this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh a fireplace are you kidding me! Does this work? I didnt know there was a fireplace. A fireplace thats incredible. How do you get all that wood in here? They deliver it. They deliver wood? Yeah. What do you tip a wood guy? I didnt know there was a fireplace. Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden. A garden! I cant believe theres a garden! Would I have to get a gardener? Yeah you can get a gardener. You tip him? You can. (to Elaine) You dont tip a gardener! You can tip a gardener. You dont need a gardener. Jerry you can barbecue back here. They deliver the coal? Sure its...probably the same guy who delivers the wood. Oh then I gotta tip him. Oh damn this place is incredible look at all this great light! I dont have any plants. I have plants. (snorts) Jerry look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this what do you think? I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think George? Its your decision. Im takin it Im takin the place. Im gonna take it this is gonna be my new place. Im livin here...Im movin. (laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible! (unenthusiastic) Congratulations. What about the couch? You like the couch? Ill tell you what Im gonna do. What? Youre movin in youre a good friend I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now take it out the door I dont even wanna see it go get it out. A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch? Yeah! For this couch?! Okay you tell me. What is it worth? Okay uh Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know maybe...twenty dollars? Yeah? (from the intercom) Yeah its George. Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh all right forget it Im gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) Im just gonna pack up the cushions right now... Okay okay okay okay you win. Forty dollars. (continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end cause I wanna get it in the hall. Fifty dollars okay? Fifty dollars is that all right? Fifty dollars? Uh-huh. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Hey whats goin on? I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars. (to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right gee three years that kinda seems like a long time. (frantic) Oh Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry listen if if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all at all. Do not feel like you have to take it. Why? If youre having second thoughts if you didnt want it dont worry about it because uh you know I I...I could take it you know. You could take it? You want it? No I dont want it. I want it if you dont want it. So you do want it. No I I want it if you dont want it. You just said you wanted it! No Im saying if a situation arose in which you didnt want it I might take it. So take it. How can I take it? How can I take it? Its your apartment! How can I want it now if you want it? Excuse me uh I dont mean to cause any trouble here but George if you take it can I take your place? Yes but I am not taking it. I...am not taking it. Well one of you better damn well take it! Well whaddaya wanna do here? I I dont know. Do you wanna flip a coin? Who flips? Youll flip Ill call. Okay fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying no guilt winner takes all and thats it. Agreed? Im good. I dont know who to root for Georges place has carpeting. All right now you call it in the air. No catchin. No no. Flip it. Heads! Tails! No it hit the table it hit the table. So what? Interference! You cant count that! Come on are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything it affects it. You didnt call no interference! You dont have to call that! Thats a rule! I dont believe this. Oh oh oh all right fine Jerry you win. Take it just take it! I dont wanna win it like this! Elaine what do you think? Id better not. Well Ill tell you what. Ill choose you for it. Straight choose three takes it no disputes...thats it you gotta win three. Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. Ill choose you. Whaddaya want? Odds. I want evens. Good. You got odds. You got evens. Right ready? For the apartment. Once twice three shoot! Mine! Once twice three shoot! Mine! Once twice three shoot! Mine! Once twice three shoot! Congratulations...congratulations. Thanks. Im just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? Jerry I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall? Yeah. The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me. Hard to imagine. Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him I tested him like I...this is what I said to him like I I was like this I went Oh by the way I know about the stuff. ..you know very casually Right. (contd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence. So what did he say? What stuff? Ooh (to Elaine) case closed! No you dont understand you see he swallowed. See the guy he swallowed. Oh he was nervous about something! Now Im gonna go over there Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes maybe youd better call the police. Okay starting...NOW! Yeah! One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say: He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law it holds up. Your Honour my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go Did he call it? Well no he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it case closed. Objection overruled. I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner. Its a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So what are you gettin? I dont know I cant eat. You you cant have anything anymore. Look at this look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred Im sayin to them How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose you dont know. All right forget it forget it. Im not taking the place! What?! How can I live there? Why not?! Look at you youre still thinking about it. Ill never feel comfortable. Oh get outta here. How can I ever have you over? Youll sit there moping. I wont mope. Youre already moping! Would you take the place? No impossible! Its your apartment. You found the place. You won the choose. All right forget it its over Im not moving. Well me neither. Definitely? Definitely. Alright then just get rid of it. You wont have any problem. No its not a problem I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon. What apartment? Oh its a great place its uh two-bedroom uh west 83rd bout half block from the park. Whats the rent? I dont know what were doin here this is ridiculous. She wanted to thank us for the apartment. I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch. If only the coin hadnt hit the table. The table is interference you know it! It is not! It is too! My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel. Hi. Hi Carol. I just wanted to introduce you to my husband this is Larry. This is George Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment. Oh you dont know how grateful I am if theres anything I can ever do to repay you I I mean were just so thrilled with this place. Its a dream. Im running in the park now Ive lost weight were barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable. Were really glad for you. Couldnt be happier. Its wonderful. Diane Diane come here. This is my new next door neighbour Diane. (to Diane) These are the guys who turned this place down can you believe it? (to Jerry George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. Shes a masseuse! How how could you guys have turned this place down its such a great location and its...so close to the park. Were aware of the proximity to the park yes. Well it was nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. How late are the stores open? Im thinking of maybe uh buying a new TV and smash it over my head. Whats the rent?]
3,1,3,[I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something. I dont think you did anything wrong. I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you. We can only thank God for that. Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now. Youre imagining this. Really. Oh no. No no no no. Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket. What floss? When? We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers. Ah mint. Of course. So Im looking at it. I look up I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just.. So let me get this straight. She saw the floss you panicked and you told her you liked her. If I didnt put that floss in my pocket Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses. And youre sure the floss was the catalyst? Yes I am. You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that? What? You dont like this? It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal. (to the phone) Oh theyve got a cure for cancer. See its all big business. Oh hey Jerry just walked in. Hi George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay here he is. (to Kramer) Who is it? Take it. Who is it? Its for you. (to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh nothing much... Tuesday? Uh Tuesday no. Im meeting somebody... Uh Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone. Well its your phone. He wanted to talk to you. Maybe I didnt want to talk to him. Well why not? He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday. What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going? Were going. Thats next Wednesday. Oh. Who is this guy? His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved. Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh hi Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie... Can you conduct your business elsewhere? (ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah. I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy Ill tell you that. I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention. I dont understand why you spend time with this guy. What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman theres a precendent. You know the relationship goes sour you end it. No no no no you have to approach this as if he was a woman. Just break up with him? Absolutely. You just tell him the truth. The Truth. As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say Bill I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is So whats in the refrigerator? ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think uh Geraldo. You know I read the Lenny Bruce biography I thought it was really... interesting. He would- (to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey were starving here! Weve been waiting here for ten minutes already! (testing Joel) So Im thinking about going to Iran this summer. I have to eat! I mean Im hypoglycemic. Anyway the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know its their annual terrorist luncheon. Yeah. (contd) Im gonna do it in Farsi. Do you think I need a haircut? Are you ready? Yeah Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat. (to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This uh this turkey sandwich here is that real turkey or is it a turkey roll? I dont want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it. I think its real turkey. Is there a real bird in the back? No theres not bird but- Well how do you know for sure? Look why dont you do me a favor. Why dont you go in the back and find out okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable. How can you talk to someone like that? What are you saying? What you like turkey roll? Listen Joel. Theres something I have to tell you... (laughing) Wait youll never guess who I ran into. Howard Metro. He asked me if I still saw you. I said Sure I see him all the time. Were still great friends. Anyway Howard says hello. (laughs) Listen Joel I dont think we should see each other anymore. What? This friendship: Its not working. Not working? What are you talking about? Were just not suited to be friends. How can you say that? Look youre a nice guy its just that... we dont have anything in common. (starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did. Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you its me. Its- this is very difficult. Look I know I call you too much right? I mean I know youre a very busy guy. No its not that. (crying) Youre one of the few people I can talk to. Oh come on. Thats not true. I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean Im your biggest fan! I know I know. I mean youre my best friend. Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment. I cannot believe that this is happening. I cant believe it. Okay okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it. Didnt mean what? What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress. Oh youve been under a lot of stress. Just can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on. Tonight? No next Wednesday. If it was tonight I wouldve said tonight. Do you really want me to go? (lying) Yes. Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah okay. Great! That would be thatd be great. So next Wednesday. Next Wednesday. Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey! ...she calls me up at my office Yeah. (contd) she says We have to talk. Ugh the four worst words in the English language. That or Whos bra is this? That is worse. So we order lunch and were talking. Finally she blurts out how its not working. Really. So Im thinking as shes saying this Im thinking: great the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision: Do I walk or do I eat? Hm. You ate. We sat there for twenty minutes chewing staring at each other in a defunct relationship. Someone says Get out of my life and that doesnt affect your appetite? Have you ever had their egg salad? It is unbelievable. Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich. How much could you possibly have in there? Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change. Yeah? Whered he go to an arcade? (sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy. Cmon move up. Oh great Ewings hurt. Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out? A couple of days at the most but... Geez. Oh God. I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing. Listen George little problem with the game. What about it? The thing is yesterday I kind of.. uh.. What? I gave your ticket to Horneck. (not believing him) You what?! Yeah Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck. No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck? Cmon cmon go ahead move up. Why did you give him my ticket for? You didnt see him. It was horrible. Oh cmon Jerry. I cant believe this. I had to do it. Oh please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills? Im sorry sir. We cant do that. Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind. Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look they did this for me before. Look I can give you these and you can roll them yourself. You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What should I quit my job?! No I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all you know that part you go to the bank its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please. ...thirty-two thirty-three- George. Not now. Could you stop the counting? Nnnnnnngaaa! What?! Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug. Oh yeah sure. Keep your money. Well then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets. Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart and twists it.) Go go! I- no I dont want to go. He was really crying? I had to give him a tissue. In fact let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets then we can go? George the man wept. Oh hey guys. Man Im telling you this pizza idea is really going to happen. This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza? Yeah we give you the dough you smash it you pound it you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese and then- you slide it into the oven. You know you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven! Its all supervised. Oh well... All of it. You want to invest? My moneys all tied up in change right now. No Im tellin you people they really want to make their own pizza pie. I-I have to say something. With all due respect I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life under any circumstance wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright Thats you. Im just saying..Alright. Okay okay. I just wanted to check with you guys. Okay. You know this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay. One day youll beg me to make your own pie. (to the phone) Hi Joel.

Its a list of excuses its for that guy Horneck whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing? I got some for you. I dont need any more. No no no no no these are good. Listen listen: You ran out of underwear you cant leave the house. (not amused) Very funny. How about: Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan. Im Dan. Can I have my list back please? Here here. Jerry Seinfeld I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile. What can I do? Deal with it. Be a man! Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus. You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab. Couple of tough monkeys. Oh hi Elaine hey. (to Jerry) Hey you missed a great game tonight buddy! Game? Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. Were getting hit by sweat! Wait. How does Horneck know you? Last week. When I you know gave you the phone. Hes really into my pizza place idea! This is too much. Wait what pizza place idea? Oh no. You get to make your own pie! Oh that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun. Yea.

So thanks again for those tickets. But next week Im going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why dont you come along? Oh no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice. Right. I forgot about choir. We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems. Right. You know the Wall being down and everything. What about Thursday night? I mean theyre playing the Sonics. Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors. You know I should really try something like that. You really should. Well lets just take a look here. Forty-one home games. Lets see saturday night weve got the Mavericks. If you dont like the Mavericks next Tuesday: Lakers. I mean you gotta like Magic right? Lets see on the road on the road on the road on the road back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You cant miss Air Jordan... You know I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends and you have to accept it. You see them you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them they call you. You dont call back they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say Hey its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.]
4,1,4,[I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor. I never heard him say anything really funny. But its common sense. Hes got super strength super speed. Im sure hes got super humor. You would think that but either youre born with a sense of humor or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth. Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth? I dont know. But he aint funny. I know I know. Im sorry Im late. No problem. I dropped a grape. Pardon? I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went. Were you crying? I mean its just a grape. Youll find it. No Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with... Robert. Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know I finally meet a normal man and I cant even go into his apartment you know. And of course my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats. Guys with cats... I dont know. Ive been thinking about asking this girl Im uh seeing- Vanessa. Vanessa thank you. Ive been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days. Oh no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What do you know this woman a month? Lets see youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon. (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it. Thats exquisite. Listen uh if its not too much trouble could you pass me that paper over there? You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel. Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it. Youre getting what? A stock. What stock? Did you ever meet my friend Simons? Maybe. He knows this guy Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too. How highs it suppose to go? I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it? Boy... I dont know. Id do it but I dont have any money. What kind of company is it? Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera. Televising opera? Some sort of electronic thingy. Well how much are you going to invest? Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand. Boy... Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it. What if I lose it? Cmon go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on come on. Were in it together. All right. Twenty-five hundred. Thats it. Yeah can I take your order? (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser. My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich. Tuna? Oh the dolphin thing? Theyre dying in the nets. Ohhh... You know the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna. Jerry cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine? Hey when Im driving I let people in ahead of me all the time. Im always waving everybody in. Go ahead go ahead go ahead. ...All right. All right. Ill have a chicken salad. And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee. Okay. (To George) What about you? Ill have the tuna. I have to say those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me. Why didnt you do something? What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean beyond that Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me do you have these in the puffs? No puffs. Just flakes. Yeah Ive been thinking about it. You know my friend told me about this great place in Vermont. I dont know. I just worry about trips like this. Its a lot of pressure. Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days. Oh so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two? Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes increased phone call frequency walking around naked. You know the presents get a lot better in Phase Two. Really? Could we go fishing up there? Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues carp marlin? They have marlin in Vermont? Oh big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin) Jerry the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down. Is that my paper? Bad news my friend. What? What news? Oh cmon! Its down again?! Two and a half points. Oh I cant believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) Thats four and a half points in three days! Thats almost half my money! Hey I told you. (sarcastic) Yeah you told me. Its all manipulated with junk bonds. You cant win. Theres one thing I dont understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza please. Hey I dont care. Im just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock now! (to the phone) George whats going on?! Sell it just say Im selling! (to the phone) Well where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my moneys gone... Well call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasnt been home or in his office in the past three days! You know I cant believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you couldve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser. Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one? Okay youre in a restaurant. Youve got a very big meeting coming up... Okay... (looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man you got mustard on your tie! (going along with it) Oh No! You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then youre gone. Youre gone all right. (Looking at map) Hey where where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what... Yeah Im going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days. Hey can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend. What friends? Well its just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) Cause theyre really good people Jerry. Im telling you. You know theyre anarchists. Theyre.. theyre.. theyre.. huge. George- What?! Youre kidding... Well whats wrong?... So what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right Ill speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson the guy whos supposed to tell us when to sell the stock hes in the hospital. So you dont know whats wrong with him? All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital. Okay fine. Has Simons been in touch with him? Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet thats all. Well this is it. Im selling. Just give it a little more time. I never shouldve gotten involved in this. Im a nervous wreck. Im not cut out for investing. All right all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there. Where? To the hospital. The hospital? Im going to find out whats going on. All right? Are you nuts? You dont even know the guy. So what? Ill start talking to him you know casual and Ill work my way around to it. What if hes in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) How you feeling Mr. Wilkinson? (He makes a hissing sound.) By the way whats happening with Sendrax? Maybe hes resting. Who goes to the hospital to rest? What are you a doctor? Okay fine fine. When are you going down there? Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me. All right. (to the woman) Boy I have to get to a bathroom. (to Jerry) May I help you? Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it. When did you bring it in? Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?! You got a receipt? I cant find the receipt. You should get the receipt. Look forget about the receipt all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?! Yes but how do I know we did the shirt? What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt. Maybe you asked for it to be washed. No! Dry-cleaned. Let me explain to you something okay? With certain types of fabrics different chemicals can react causing- You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it! (looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it. I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner Well its ruined. And of course the dry cleaner can respond Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going Come on hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today! Bless you. Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten so dont give me hygiene. I dont know. I cant think of any solution unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats? Well it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen fourteen bucks a cat? What do you think Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks? Im no cat killer. How about we go over there right now and we shave them? Id really like to go Elaine. But George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go. He actually went to the hospital? Yeah. Oh man hes nuts. Yeah hes nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know I know. Its down again. How much are you down altogether? I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars. Wow. You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George. Oh look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry come here. Take a look at this. I really dont need to look. What a body. Yeeaahh. Thats for me. Yeah and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up. Im gonna go down there and try and talk to her. What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there? Fifteen seconds. You told him you knew Simons? Yeah I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy hes very strong. Well thats it. Look Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling. Didnt work huh? (laughs) Not quite. We-Well what are you gonna do about the stock? Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship. So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now. I know. You mentioned it. Oh yeah right. (thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it? No its got a little battery. Well thats good. (thinking) Well the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) Thats the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room? No its okay. So I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold charming? Not especially. Well what do you want to do this afternoon? What can we do? Its raining. We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing? Oh youve never heard of it. No what? What kind is it? I cant tell you. (thinking) Yeah thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me sir. Could I have a look at that business section? That stock? I thought you got out of that? I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points! I told you not to sell. You did not tell me not to sell. I said the market fluctuates. Remember? Look Vanessa of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars! Thats probably why were- What? Forget it. No what? Thats probably why.. Thats probably why were staying here because you lost money on the stock. (thinking) So what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume... (laughing) Have something else. Cmon have a little dessert? Elaine get something! Its all taken care of. Im kinda full. So dont finish it. (acidly) Shes full. So Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there all told? I dont like to discuss figures. How much? I dont know what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money Wilkinson cleaned up. So Wilkinsons out of the hospital now? Oh god. Is that still from the cats? No I just have a cold. So what ever happened with that? I gave him an ultimatum. He chose the cats? Theyre very clean animals. I gotta say thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat. Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume. I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont... Superman can go back in time? We went over that. Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher. A robot butcher? Shhhhh. If you want to get in theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No no no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on come on come on... Im not an investor. People always tell me you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times it gets fired. You go back there What happened? I had my money. It was here it was working for me. Yeah I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.]
5,2,1,[She cant kill me right? No of course not. People break up all the time. Everyday. It just didnt work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldnt. You tried. I kept looking at her face. Id go Cmon love her. Love her! Did you tell her you loved her? Oh I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! Shed tell me she loved me. All right at first I just look at her. Id go Oh really? Or uh Boy thats thats something. But eventually you have to come back with Well I love you. You know you can only hold out for so long. Youre a human being. And I didnt even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I cant do that to someone. Youre too nice a guy. I am. Im a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment Im sitting on the couch shes on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom I come back shes on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldnt do that. I wouldve insulted her. Youre flesh and blood. I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends I didnt want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. This is Nancy this is Susan this is Amy this is my cousin this is my brother this is my father... Its like Im in quicksand. I told you when I met her. My back is killing me. You gotta go to my chiropractor hes the best. Oh yeah everybodys guy is the best. Im gonna make an appointment for you. Well go together. Please. They dont do anything. Look do I have to break up with her in person? Cant I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things. You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off! Hi. Hi. Hey what are you doing? Im letting you in. Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation. No you wont. Yes I will George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat. Okay. Why cant you sit in the middle? Please it doesnt look good. Boy boy girl. Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic arent ya? Is it that obvious? Hello Jerry. Hello. Did you get a haircut? No shower. So where are we eating? Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher or something. Anyway after we met whenever wed run into each other on the street or in the lobby or whatever we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy hes got a family. Then after a while I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So fine. I figure thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing. (singing; imitating Tony Bennett) You know Id go from nods to nothing... And now theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing. A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in The Blob. I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him. Really? Yes. You would do that? If I was a different person. Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... Im sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes I know I have the wrong number but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if... (to the intercom) Come on up. (to the phone) Oh its you again. See now if you had answered me I wouldnt have had to do this. Now thats two long distance calls I made to you why cant you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much. Taste this. No I just had a sandwich. No taste it. Taste it. I dont want cantaloupe now. Youve never had cantaloupe like this before... I only eat cantaloupe at certain times... ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe. ...all right! Uh-huh. Its good? Its very good. Good huh? Good. I got it at Joes. Uh-huh. Forty-nine cents a pound. Thats practically half than what youre paying at the supermarket. I dont know why you dont go to Joes. Its too far. Its three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart.. Im not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll em down below my knee? See the other thing is if you dont like anything he takes it right back. I dont return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in. Im outta there. I did it! Its over. You did it? What happened? I told her. In the kitchen  which was risky cause its near all the knives. I started with the word Listen. Uh-huh... I said Listen Marlene and then the next thing I know Im in the middle of it. And theres this voice inside of me going Youre doing it! Youre doing it! And then she started to cry and I weakened a bit. I almost relented but the voice Jerry the voice said Keep going keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break you know and Im heading for the wall and I trip and I twist my ankle and they throw the light on you you know. So somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang! Son of a boom! I get to the top of the wall  the front door. I opened it up Im one foot away I took one last look around the penitentiary and I jumped! See its never as bad as you imagine. I liked Marlene. Whats her number? Uh no I I dont think so. (to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking? George I want you to taste this cantaloupe. Oh no thank you. Its the best cantaloupe I ever had. No really. No no thanks. Jerry tell him how good this cantaloupe is. Its very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So thats it? Youre out? Except for one small problem. Hah I left some books in her apartment. So go get them. Oh no no I cant go back there. Jerry its so awkward and you know it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen Id be right back where I started from. So forget about the books. Did you read them? Well yeah. What do you need them for? I dont know. Theyre books. What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like theyre trophies. What do you need it for after you read it? Theyre my books. So you want me to get the books? Is that it? ...so it mustve been ninety-five degrees that night and everyones just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I dont know I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself Marlene just do it. And I jumped in. And as Im getting out I feel all these eyes on me and I look up and everyone is just staring at me. So whatd you do? Well nothing. Its no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didnt see what the big attraction was. Well I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess. Hey you know Jerry just because George and I dont see each other anymore it doesnt mean we shouldnt stay friends. No. Good enough. Im really glad we got that settled. I dont know how this happened. Jerry its not my fault. No no. Its not your fault. Books books I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know its not like Marlenes a bad person or anything but my God! I mean weve had like three lunches and a movie and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And its these meaningless purposeless blather calls. She never asks if Im busy or anything. I just pick up the phone and shes in the middle of a sentence! Its standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine? (disgusted) Ohh! You know and sometimes shell go (imitates Marlene) Hello Jerry? And Ill go Oh hi Marlene. And then its Jerry... I dunno sometimes... What trying to get off the phone? (more disgusted) Ohhhh! You cant! Its impossible! Theres no break in the conversation where you can go All right then... You know it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean I gotta put a stop to this. Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Dont you think? Yeah. Yes she is. Mr. Costanza? Yeah. The doctor will see you now. (to Jerry sarcastically) Yeah doctor. Im going to have to wait in that little room all by myself arent I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctors office.) Oh hello Doctor. The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. Cause it says Waiting Room. Theres no chance of not waiting. Cause they call it the waiting room theyre gonna use it. Theyve got it. Its all set up for you to wait. And you sit there you know and youve got your little magazine. You pretend youre reading it but youre really looking at the other people. You know youre thinking about about them. Things like I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes Im getting her magazine. And then they finally call you and its a very exciting moment. They finally call you and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. Well I guess Ive been chosen. Ill see you all later. You know so you think youre going to see the doctor but youre not are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room. But if they are you know doing some sort of medical thing to you you want to be in the smallest room that they have I think. You dont wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters that they have with like stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in? Do they scalp tickets to these things? I got two for the Winslow tumor I got two... So how was it? I was in there for two minutes. He didnt do anything. Touch this feel that  seventy-five bucks! Well its a first visit. Whats seventy-five bucks?! What am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I dont understand this. Im only paying half. You cant do that. Why not? Hes a doctor. You gotta pay what he says. Oh no no no. I pay what I say. Are you feeling weird? No Im fine. Nothing really happened. Yeah I know. We just kissed a little. People kiss. Yeah. Well... night. (belated) Good night. Hey. Hey. I got it! This time I got it! Hips! See its all hips. Uh-huh. You gotta come through with the hips first. That is out there. Joes? No supermarket. Well is it good? Its uh okay. Let me taste it. See that stinks. You cant eat that. You should take that back. Im not taking it back. All right Ill take it back. Im going by there. I dont care about it. Jerry you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation. All right. Take it back. Leave a message Ill call you back. (from the phone) Jerry have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If Im not talking into the soap right now call me back. Well? Marlene. (smiles) Oh. Oh Marlene... Yeah I took her home one night  we kinda started up a little bit in the car. I thought you were trying to get rid of her? I was. But shes got me like hypnotized. Does George know? No hed go nuts. Yeah no kidding. I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean Ive seen her a couple of times since then and I know I cant go any further but... Shes just got this like psychosexual hold over me. I just want her I cant breathe. Its like a drug. Whoa psychosexual. I dont know how Im going to tell him. Man I dont understand people. I mean why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me? Its partially you yeah. Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know? Well he cant kill me right? Youre a human being. I mean she called me. I havent called her. She started it. Youre flesh and blood. Im a nice guy. Hi. (excited) Oh my little airplane lamp. You know you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones. Well the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices because you dont have to be home on time. Unless youre married to a dictator. Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people. Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe? Nope. No good. Well you know what they say. Lucky in love Unlucky with fruit. Well Im taking this back. So I had what you might call a little encounter this morning. Really? That guy who stopped saying hello? Yes. You talked to him? Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first I was just going to walk on by but then I thought No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man. Right. So I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said Hi remember me? And he furrows his brow as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him I said You little phony. You know exactly who I am. You said you little phony? I did. I most certainly did. And he said he goes Oh yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said Well how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by? This is amazing. And he says he says Look I just didnt want to say hello anymore All right? And I said Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it! You are the Queen of Confrontation. Youre my new hero. In fact youve inspired me. Im gonna call George about something right now. This cantaloupe stinks. (considers for a second) I dont care. Youre kidding. No I dont care. You mean that? Absolutely. You dont care? No. How could you not care? I dont know. But I dont. Im actually almost happy to hear it. I thought youd be upset. I guess I should be but Im not. Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible? Youre a fine person. Youre a humanitarian. Shes very sexy. That voice. That voice. Shes driving me crazy. I know. I know. So I can see her tonight and you dont care? See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. Shes too crazy for me. All right. As long as youre okay. Because I cant stop thinking about her. Im okay. Im fine. Im wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life. Good. And Ill tell you what... You dont have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill. (shocked and angry) You paid that crook?! I had to. He didnt do anything Jerry. Its a scam! Who told you to do that? It was embarrassing to me. Oh I was trying to make a point. Why dont you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) Whats wrong? (gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?! So you wanna come up for a few minutes? Im sorry Jerry. I just dont think this is gonna work. Really? I thought... I know Im sorry. Gee I just didnt expect it from the way youve been acting. You sure you want to talk about this? Cause I sure dont. Of course I want to talk about it. Well okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night. Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night? I saw your act. My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything? Well to be honest it just didnt make it for me. Its just so much fluff. I cant believe this. So what are you saying? You didnt like my act so thats it? I cant be with someone if I dont respect what they do. Youre a cashier! Look Jerry its just wasnt my kind of humor. You cant go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible. I heard the material. I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend. Women need to like the job of the guy theyre with. If they dont like the job they dont like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony bogus names for the jobs that we have. Well right now Im the regional management supervisor. Im in development research consulting... Men on the other hand  if they are physically attracted to a woman  are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men dont really care. Menll just go Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? Youre just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen why dont you shower up and well get some burgers and catch a movie.]
6,2,2,[You have so many nice jackets. I dont know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? Whats wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty you cant wear this! Are you getting that? I thought you were getting it. Should I pick up? You want me to get that? Ill get it! Ill get it! Hello?... Hello? Hi. Hi. (to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! So howd you do? We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! Well be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life. This is your greatest moment? A game? Well no. Sharon Besser of course. You know what my greatest moment was dont you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat. Jerry look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party? Well the mans an individualist  he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what hes doing. But its their 50th anniversary. Your mother doesnt like my taste in clothing. You know I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go. First of all I made plans with Elaine. So bring her. I dont even know them. What is she your second cousin? I mean Ive met them three times in my life. I dont know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this and then she criticizes my jacket. At least come and say hello have a cup of coffee then youll leave. How come he gets to leave? If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo I am leaving. Hes always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess its because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation. And its always about Jeffrey right? Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department. Morty are you coming in? Oh yeah. I forgot all about it. (to Jerry) Hey howd you do? We won. Were in the finals on Wednesday. Yeah! (to Kramer and Morty) What is this about? Im completely changing the configuration of the apartment. Youre not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle. What are you doing? Levels. Levels? Yeah Im getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And Im going to build these different levels with steps and itll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know like ancient Egypt. You drew up plans for this? No no. Its all in my head. I dont know how youre going to be comfortable like that. Oh Ill be comfortable. When do you intend to do this? Ohh... should be done by the end of the month. Youre doing this yourself? Its a simple job. Why you dont think I can? Oh no. Its not that I dont think you can. I know that you cant and Im positive that you wont. Well I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber. Hey thats some big job. I dont see it happening. Well this time this time youre wrong. Cmon. Ill even bet you. Seriously? I dont want you betting. Morty dont let him bet. A big dinner with dessert. But Ive got till the end of the month. Ill give you a year. No no no. End of the month. Its a bet. (to Elaine) Seriously do you wanna switch chairs? No no. Im fine. Jerry are you listening to this? Yeah Uncle Leo. So so now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation. Right. For the reducing of the pond scum? No for the walking tours. Oh yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour. Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department you know who he calls? Mickey Mantle? (saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great! (eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor. Mmm... phenomenal peas. Are you ready for dessert? Well actually we do have to kind of get going. (surprised) Youre going? Oh uh I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting. Yeah I cant eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up and I cant dance. Hes kidding Manya. Is that a joke? So did you hear Claires getting married? Yeah yeah.. I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know trotters like at Yonkers. Horses? Theyre like big riding dogs. What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies... I know I hated those kids. In fact I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up. (angry) I had a pony. Well I didnt uh really mean a pony per se... When I was a little girl in Poland we all had ponies. My sister had pony my cousin had pony... So whats wrong with that? Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing... Should we have coffee? Whos having coffee? He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him. Well Im sure you did. Who wouldnt love a pony? Who wouldnt love a person that had a pony? You! You said so! No see we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.. Thats it! I had enough! Have your coffee everybody. Shes a little upset. Its been an emotional day. I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesnt make sense. Am I wrong? Ill drive you to the airport. No were taking a cab. I just hope that whole pony incident didnt put a damper on the trip. Dont be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding. Hey I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony. Well if you ever talk to her tell her Im sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible. You know you should give Manya a call. Maybe I will. Oh hi. I uh just came to say goodbye. Need any help with those? Its nothing. I got it. So how are your levels coming along? Oh well... I decided Im not gonna do it. (laughing) Really? What a shock. Goodbye Jerry. Take care. Well call you. Bye Jer. Bye Dad. Take it easy. Bye Mr. Kramer. Yeah. So long Morty. So when do I get my dinner? Theres no dinner. The bets off. Im not gonna do it. Yes I know youre not gonna do it. Thats why I bet. Ya well theres no bet if Im not doing it. Thats the bet! That youre not doing it! Yeah well I could do it. I dont wanna do it. We didnt bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done. And it could be done. Well of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if its done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels! I dont want the levels! Thats the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh hi... (Kramer leaves) no they just left... Oh my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Dont get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!! Who did you talk to? Uncle Leo. And whens the funeral? I dont know. He said hed call back. You know what this means dont you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable. She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless... What? What? Nothing. You dont think... What? The pony remark? Oh dont be ridiculous. She was an old woman. You dont think that I killed her? You know what the flight backll cost us? It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony! Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota I think. The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) Thats probably Uncle Leo. Hello?... Yes I know... Well its just one of those things... Sure sure well see you then. The funerals Wednesday. Wednesday? What what Wednesday? Two o clock Wednesday. Ah What? Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship. So? Youre not obligated. Go play in your game. I didnt even know the woman. So dont go. I mean I met her three times. I dont even know her last name. Jerry no ones forcing you. I mean who has a funeral on a Wednesday? Thats what I want to know. I mean its the championship Im hitting everything. I dont have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You dont have anything. I got my sport jacket. Youre not wearing that to a funeral. Whats wrong with it? It looks ridiculous. What? Im gonna buy a new sport jacket now? I dont know what to do. (depressed) You know what this funerals gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy! We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And uh I mean hey you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now is he going to a meeting or is he catching forty winks? I mean lets make up our mind where we think theyre going. I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game? Two Forty-Five. And what times the funeral? Two o clock. How long does a funeral take? Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure even Oswald took forty-five minutes. So you cant do both? You know if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something I wouldnt expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand. How can you even consider not going? You know Ive been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which Ill ever have the opportunity to have sex again. Hows it gonna happen? I just dont see how it could occur. You know funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me dead. Imagine that. They always make me take stock of my life. And how Ive pretty much wasted all of it and how I plan to continue wasting it. I know and then you say to yourself From this moment on Im not gonna waste any more of it. But then you go How? What can I do thats not wasting it? Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people? You know I cant believe youre even considering not playing. We need you. Youre hitting everything. He has to go. He may have killed her. Me? What about you? You brought up the pony. Oh yeah but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one. (to Jerry) Whos going to play left field? Bender. Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going I cant believe Jerry didnt show up. Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that? If youre a spirit and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies and find out the mysteries of the universe you think shes gonna wanna hang around Drexlers funeral home on Ocean Parkway? George I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions. You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? Its not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) Its all mental. Fifty years they were married. Now hes moving to Pheonix. Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment? I dont know. Theyve been in there since like World War II. The rents three hundred a month. Three hundred a month? Oh my God. Although this may seem like a sad event it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world  a simpler world  with loving parents a beautiful home in the country and from what I understand she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years whenever she would speak of it her eyes would light up. Its lustrous coat its flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow. Well the games starting just about now. It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture. Im not a doctor yet Uncle Morty. Im just an intern. I cant write a note to an airline. Youve got your degree. They dont care. They just want to see something. I just wanted to say how sorry I was... Jerry you wanna hear something? Your cousin Jeffrey is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation you understand? Yeah. Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So thats your cousin. You dont understand Ive never paid a full fare. Once again I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night. Oh me too. Oh no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad. So I understand youre moving to Phoenix? Yeah my brother lives there. I think Manya wouldve liked Phoenix. Mmm gorgeous exquisite town. So whats happening with your apartment? Of course its very hot there. Ill have to get uh air conditioner. Oh you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isnt listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue? Although they say its a dry heat. Dry wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment? I dont even know if I should take my winter clothing. I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it. Oh the apartment. Jeffreys taking the apartment. Oh Jeffrey. You know Jeffery? Its raining. Its raining? Its raining. The game will be postponed. Well play tomorrow. Believe me I wouldnt bother you if the army hadnt closed that base in Sarasota. Here scribble a little something here. I cant. Ill get in trouble. Oh for Gods sake! Who gets picked off in softball? Its unheard of. Its never happened to me before. I remember saying to myself Why is Jerry so far off the base? Ill have to live with this shame for the rest of my life. And then in the fifth inning why did you take off on the pop fly? I thought there were two outs. I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something. (smiling) What about Sharon Besser? Oh well of course. Nineteen-seventy-three. Makes you wonder though doesnt it? Wonder about what? You know... (looking up) the spirit world. You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me? I never saw anyone play like that. But I went to the funeral. Yeah but that doesnt make up for killin her. Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day. Dont you think she woulda heard I was there? Not necessarily. Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony? What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean police dont use them for you know crowd control. (Jerry crouches down and makes like hes riding a pony.) Hey uh you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey little boy. Yeah Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody I assume genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean could they make them like the size of a quarter if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly though wouldnt it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... Baltic thats two down go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah thats it. Fine. Right there hold it right there.]
7,2,3,[Well I might have something in the back. The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back theyd put it out in the front. Why dont they open up an entire store for the back? Call it Just Back. All back; No front. You walk in the front youre immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look Elaine tie carwash. Oh I just read that. Thats terrific. (pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that. Alton Benes is your father? Yeah. I always felt he deserved a wider audience. Im not so sure he wants one. Hey dont forget Sunday okay? You and George are coming right? Hotel Westbury eight oclock. I guess Im coming. I mean... What? What you dont want to go now? No Ill go. Im going. No Jerry you have to. I need a buffer. You know I havent seen my father in a while and... you know... Im worried I wont be able to talk to him. Hes such a great writer. Frankly I prefer the company of nitwits. So thats why were not together anymore. What is this? This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right. Try it on. Wow this is soft suede. This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. How much is it? (shocked) Oh my God. Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad? You have no idea. I have some idea. No idea. Ive got a ballpark. There is no park and the team has relocated. Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high. Oh man that is a beautiful jacket though. Whats with the pink lining and the candy stripes? Well its just a lining. You can always have it changed. Should I get it? I hate these moments. Im hearing the dual voices now you know What about the money? Whats money? It looks wonderful on you. Hey. Hey. New jacket? What do you think? Its beautiful. Is it me? Thats definitely you. Really? Thats more you than youve ever been. Hey what is with the pink lining? I dont know. Its got a pink lining. Oh... So what did you pay for this? How much? Whats the difference? What youre not gonna tell me? Id rather not say it out loud. Its embarrassing. Over three hundred? Yes but lets just stop it right there. Its over four hundred? Is it over four hundred? Would you? Woah Nelson! I know I know. What are you gonna do with the leather one? I dont know. Well are you gonna wear it? Maybe. Youre not going to wear this. Do you want it? Well yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket. Okay take it. Heey good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerrys old jacket and stands next to Jerry looking in the mirror.) Oh baby. (singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a... What is that song? Oh its from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I cant get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. Im singin it on elevators buses. Im singin it in front of clients. Its taken over my life. You know Schumann went mad from that. Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee? No you idiot. What are you Bud Abbott? What are you callin me an idiot? You dont know Robert Schumann? The composer? Oh Schumann. Of course. He went crazy from one note. He couldnt get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized. Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well what if it doesnt stop? Oh that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes. I know exactly whats gonna happen tonight. Im gonna try and act like Im not impressed hes gonna see right through it. Yeah hell be looking at us like hes backstage at a puppet show. Let me just get my jacket. (singing) : Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen? Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this its with a whole different confidence. Like tonight I mightve been a little nervous. But inside this jacket I am composed grounded secure that I can meet any social challenge. Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality. Absolutely. Its fabulous. I know. And Ill tell you something else Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh ho! All right! Ill tell you what if you dont say anything in the next five seconds Ill know it was over a thousand. (to Jerry) Hey. Hey would you do me a solid? Well what kind of solid? I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds. Birds? Yeah. A friend of mine hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves. So take a cab. They wont take a cage full of birds. I cant. Im on my way out. Theres no way I can do it. George do me a solid? Two minutes. Well Im going with him. Id like to... Ive never done a solid before. All right... Yeah. All right have a good one. (scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me I know his two minutes. By his conception of time his life will last over two thousand years. (singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by... Schumann. (George stops himself frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they? Maybe he didnt show up. What you dont want to do this? I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second is that him? Yeah I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Wheres Elaine? Im nervous. (to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes? Yeah? Im Jerry Elaines friend and this is George. Its a great thrill to meet you Sir. Sit down. Want a drink? Sure. Whatll you have? (to waiter) Ill have a cranberry juice with two limes. And Ill have a club soda with no ice. Ill have another Scotch with plenty of ice. You like ice? Huh? I said do you like ice? Like it? Dont you think you get more without it? Wheres Elaine? Well we thought she was meeting you earlier. Shes usually pretty punctual. Dont you find that George? Yeah yeah. Shes punctual... and uh shes been late sometimes. Yeah yeah. Sometimes shes on time and... sometimes shes late. I guess... (chuckles) today shes late. It appears that way. Yup. Yup. Looks like rain. I know I know thats what they said. Who said? The weather guy Dr. Waldo. I dont need anybody to tell me its gonna rain. No of course not. I didnt- All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (The waiter returns with the drinks and distributes them to the men.) Which ones suppose to be the funny guy? (pointing at Jerry) Oh hes the comedian. Im just a regular person. No no. Hes just being modest. We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. Theres nothing funny about that. Would you excuse me a minute? Im gonna go to the bathroom. Ill be right back. I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant. Drivel. Yea well maybe some parts. (defensive) What parts? The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh I just realized  I have to make a phone call. I-I cant believe- Would you- Thank you for leaving me alone with him! That was brutal. I cant go back out there. Well lets just leave. Elainell kill me. Where is she? Shes gotta be here soon. How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you this guy scares me. The waiter was trembling! If she doesnt show up we cant possibly have dinner with him alone. How are we gonna get out of it? Well say were frightened and we have to go home. Yeah thats good. Hed clunk our heads together like Moe. I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that. All fathers are intimidating. Theyre intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children for the rest of his life his attitude is To hell with the world I can make my own people. Ill eat whatever I want Ill wear whatever I want and Ill create whoever I want. (to George) Whod you call? (improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was. What kind of operation? Bone marrow. Mister Benes? Yes? A message for you. From Elaine. She got tied up. Shell be here in thirty minutes. Yeah they shouldve taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in fifty-three. Well Guatamala... Sure Guatamala... All right you boys get yourselves together. Well head up to the restaurant. Ill leave a note for Elaine. Im going to the bathroom. Come on lets go! What about Elaine? To hell with Elaine! Shell be furious. Were dying here! Thats her! Shes here! Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad? (contemptuously imitating Altons voice) Hes in the bathroom. (to Elaine) Where have you been?! Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes so he can pick up these birds... Oh you didnt... Well he said hed drive me here right after. So I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So they tow the car. Now I am standing outside and I am freezing but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So finally he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions that each dove has a different diet... So were wandering around trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here? Great. Couldnt be better. Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable. Oh no no. Get outta here.. Man Kramer! I could kill him! I cant believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer. Ah the lift. Like the lure of the sirens song. Never what it seems to be yet who among us can resist? Where do you come up with this stuff? Well look whos here. Oh hi Dad. Hello dear. Whos the lipstick for? No one. Hows your mother? Fine. How about you? Are you working? Yeah Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times. Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right boys. Well go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. Youre not afraid of a little spice are you? (singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open... Pipe down chorus boy. Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful. (to George) Snow. Snow that cant be good for suede can it? I wouldnt think so. What should I do? (to Alton) Uh were taking a cab arent we? Cab? Its only five blocks. (to Jerry) Why dont you just turn it inside out? Inside out! Great. Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this? Oh I turned my jacket inside out. Well you look like a damn fool! Well its a new suede jacket. It might get ruined. Well youre not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. Thats for damn sure. Its uh its only a few blocks. (to the intercom) Elaine? Yeah. Come on up. Hey. Hey. Ive gotta feed the birds. So? You got any of those mini Ritzes? I cant believe I do. Yeah! Well are you going out? Yeah. Hey wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it? I was out in the snow last night. Dont you know what that does to suede? I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three. Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time. Is he still in town? No hes driving back to Maryland tonight. So uh... what are you gonna do with that one now? I dont know. (smiling) Well... (to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this but usually he hates everyone. Really? You gonna throw this out? Well I cant wear it. Yeah he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea. (to Jerry) Well if youre just gonna throw it out you know I could take it. Yeah go ahead take it. Dad thinks George is gay. Oh because of all the singing? No he pretty much thinks everyone is gay. Hey see I like it like this. Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out. Ill try and remember that. Boy its too bad you gave me this one too. Yeah too bad. Im gonna have to do something about this lining. (singing) Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm... I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now why does moisture ruin leather? I dont get this. Arent cows outside most of the time? I dont understand it. When its raining do cows go up to the farmhouse Let us in were all wearin leather. Open the door! Were gonna ruin the whole outfit here! Is it suede? I am suede the whole thing is suede I cant have this cleaned. Its all I got!]
8,2,4,[(excited) So then as we were leaving we were just kind of standing there and she was sort of smiling at me and I wasnt sure if she wanted me to ask her out because when women smile at me I dont know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like theyre psychotic or something and I dont know if Im supposed to smile back I dont know what to do. So I just stood there like  remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? Thats what I looked like. So you didnt ask? No I froze. Counter. Oh yeah. So wait wait. A half-hour later Im back in the office I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says So why dont you call her? I says I cant. I couldnt I couldnt do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss. He said wuss? Yeah. Anyway he shamed me into it. So you called. Right. And and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone it makes you sound casual. Yeah. Like a farm boy. Right. So I call her up I tell her its me she gives me an enthusiastic Hi! Wow. The enthusiastic hi. Thats beautiful. Oh I dont get the enthusiastic hi Im outta there. All right so youre chewing your apple you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead. So were talking and I dont like to go too long before I ask them out I wanna get it over with right away so I just blurt out What are you doing Saturday night? And? She bought. Great day in the morning. Then I got off the phone right away. Sure its like robbing a bank. You dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in you hit and get out. Its amazing. We we both have dates on the same night. I cant remember the last time that happened. I cant stand doing laundry. Thats why I have forty pairs of underwear. You do not. Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way I only have to do wash once a year. (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent. Thats Irish. Irish Scottish whats the difference lassie? So uh thanks for dinner. It was great. Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again. Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee? Oh no thanks. I cant drink coffee late at night it keeps me up. (confused by his response) So um okay. Okay. Goodnight. Yeah take it easy. Thanks again for the movie. Youre welcome. Id invite you up but the place is being painted. Oh thats okay. Unless you want to go to your place. Okay... but theres no cake or anything if thats what youre looking for. (frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy! I think if ones going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note. Its common courtesy. I dont know. Thats just the way I was brought up. Values are very important. Oh so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner? Thursdays great. Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants Donna? I dont feel comfortable in them. Are those Cotton Dockers? Oh I cant begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial. Really? I like that commercial. You like that commercial? Yeah its clever. Now wait a second you mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty? Yeah thats the one. What could you possibly like about that? I dont know. I like the guys. Yeah theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other and I could be comfortable too if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session. Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry wont let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that what does that have to do with the pants? Doesnt that bother you? (annoyed) Thats the idea. Thats whats clever about it that theyre not talking about the pants. But theyre talking about nothing. Thats the point. I know the point. No one is telling you to like it. I mean all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants pants pants pants pants pants pants. What is that supposed to be? Whats brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future you have to magnify everything about them. You know like the guyll be like I dont think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life? And of course the womans looking at the guy thinking What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life? Im supposed to see her again on Thursday but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial? I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough. No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason? Oh yeah I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Hi. Youre still thinking about this? She invites me up at twelve oclock at night for coffee and I dont go up. No thank you. I dont want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee. I said this to her. People this stupid shouldnt be allowed to live. I cant imagine what she must think of me. She thinks youre a guy that doesnt like coffee. She invited me up. Coffees not coffee coffee is sex. Maybe coffee was coffee. Coffees coffee in the morning. Its not coffee at twelve oclock at night. Well some people drink coffee that late. Yeah people who work at NORAD whore on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing I was funny... I kept saying to myself Keep it up dont blow it youre doing great. Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her. I cant call her now. Its too soon. Im planning a Wednesday call. Oh why? I love it when guys call me the next day. Of course you do but youre imagining a guy you like not a guy who goes Oh no I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel a Kaiser a tsar. All shell think is that you like her. Thats exactly what Im trying to avoid! Well she wants you to like her. Yes she wants me to like her if she likes me. But she doesnt like me! I dont know what your parents did to you. Hey I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right youre up there youre on the stage and you go Hey you ever notice how cars here in New York they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation and were thinking Well sorry buddy you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years. So you gonna use it? Its funny. It is funny. I like to use my own material. Thats as good as anything you do. All right I gotta make a call. Everybody out come on. Why do we have to leave? Because I cant call a woman with other people in the room. Come on lets go. Oh see this is the problem. Youre kicking me out of my house? Yes. (encouraging) Dont forget. (to Elaine) Right alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry do you have any apples? Dont do the apples. Its enough already with the apples. (from the phone; a recorded message) Hi its Carol Ill get back to you. Um hi its George George Costanza remember me? The guy that didnt come up for coffee. You see I didnt realise that coffee didnt really mean... well whatever. Anyway it was fun. It was... it was fun so... oh boy um so... You call me back. If you want. Its up to you you know whatever you wanna do. Either way. The balls in your court. So uh take it easy. Im just gonna get my jacket Ill meet you downstairs. Whats the matter did you call? Got her machine. Im dead Im a dead man. Thats it. Im dead Im a dead man. Dead man. What did you say? I dont know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and theres nothing I can do. Its a machine. The little light is blinking right now Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody the idiots on! After one date you try and improvise on her machine? Now Im in the worst position of all. Yknow my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape. He did that? Yeah. Somebody did that? Shell call you back. Youre overreacting. Not once. Never? I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life ever. Thats amazing. Thank you. Is there anything else about you I should know? Yes Im lactose intolerant. Really? I have no patience for lactose. And I wont stand for it. Um Ill be right back. Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa ah Im sorry I didnt I had no idea. Wait wait. Hes in the bathroom. I just wanted to talk to him for a minute but Ill come back. You dont have to leave. You sure? Yes. Okay. Im Donna. Donna. Oh youre the one that likes that commercial! He told you about that? (back-pedalling) No he he didnt actually tell me that uh we were talking about that commercial  in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No he he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. Hes hes like a clam. Youre not gonna mention this to him... (to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends Im not hip because I like that commercial. What? (to George) What did what did you say? Say? What? Nothing I... You told him how I like the commercial. Well so what if I said that? Well so you didnt have to tell your friends. No I had to tell my friends  my friends didnt have to tell you. (to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble? I dont like you talking about me with your friends behind my back. Boy oh boy. I said I couldnt believe you liked that commercial. So what? I asked some friends of mine this week and all of them liked the commercial. Boy I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there. Hey. Oh uh Kramer this is Donna. Oh. Cotton Dockers! Hello! All right we should be going. Come on... What? Where are we going? Come on! Dont bother Im leaving. Donna really youre making too much of this. One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers theyre just pants Please Donna... I dont wanna hear it. I cant believe I said that. You know me Im a vault. Dont worry about it it wasnt working anyway. What happened there? Ill tell you later. You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman. Okay so you remember I made the initial call Sunday she doesnt call back. I call again Monday I leave another message. I call Tuesday I get the machine again I know youre there I dont know what your story is. Yesterday Im a volcano  I try one more call the machine comes on and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you dont call me back for four days? I dont like coffee I dont have to come up. Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face. You said that? I lost it. I cant blame you. I cant believe she never called you back. She did. Today. What? She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it. So she didnt get the messages. Exactly but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home. But what about the messages? Elaines thing? How you gonna get in? Ill meet her outside the building. But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment shes going right for that machine. Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines. Theres nothing to it. You lift the lid it comes right out. You do it for me. What? Come on itll be so much easier. How you gonna get me up there? Ill tell her I bumped into you Im giving you a ride uptown. And who makes the switch? You do. I do. I cant get involved in this. I think I may be in love with this woman. What if she sees me? Oh you are such a wuss. A wuss? Yeah. Did you call me a wuss? Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen. I got one problem. Youre keeping her busy in the other room. Now what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that shes coming. A signal right um okay uh okay the signal is Ill call out tippy-toe! Tippy Toe? I dont think so. You dont like tippy toe? No tippy toe. All right uh okay I got it um Ill sing. What song? How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? What is that? Oh its a lovely song. (singing) How do you solve a problem like Maria?... Anything else? You pick it. Lemon Tree. Peter Paul and Mary. No Trini Lopez. (singing) Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower... Alright ok. You got the tape? Standard. Micro. How do you feel? Confident? Feel good. You nervous? Not at all. Get up get up its her! Oh the hell with this Im scared to death just walk away its off cancel everything go! Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home. I I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you. Oh thats so sweet. Oh this is my friend Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is I see him all the time. All the time. Its nice to meet you. Hi. So Im starving. Where are we gonna eat? You know we could go uptown and that way we could give Jerry a ride home. Okay. Lets go Im ready whered you park? Dont you wanna go upstairs first? No what for? Ill just give my bag to the doorman. You know I really need to use the bathroom. Oh well theres a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door. Yes yes but uh I have to make a call so... Well they have a phone. I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs. (aloud) You know I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine. Right right. The bathrooms on the hall to the right. Uh you know why dont you go first you just had a long trip. No Im fine. Um you know its the damnedest thing. It went away. Oh thats weird. No no that can happen. Ive uh Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing but... Well let me just check my messages and well go. Uh Carol can I talk to you for a second? Right now? Sure. Please this is very very important. (from other room) Uh tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree! (to Jerry) Now I know who you are! Youre a comedian. Ive seen you its driving me crazy. Right. I am. Carol thats so rude. Please Im serious just for a moment if you wouldnt mind. And then well talk to Jerry. (calls) Hey you two. Im ready to go. Thats what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool? (to Jerry) Dont you find that strange? Yes. Well Ill just check my machine and well go. No nothing here lets go. (Carol George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone. Oh uh... Yours were hilarious we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that. I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didnt want to talk to I could go Excuse me Im not in right now. If you would just leave a message I could walk away. I also have a cordless phone but I dont like that as much because you cant slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone  You cant talk to me like that! Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone  You cant talk to me like that!]
9,2,5,[What did you do? Mousse. I moussed up. I guess it was just a matter of time. You know I shouldve done this years ago. I mean I feel like Ive had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now I begin my post-mousse. Hey tell me the truth have you ever seen a better looking guy? Well looks are so subjective. I dont mean to interrupt or anything but on Sunday my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon. (annoyed that he forgot) Oh I keep forgetting to enter that! She lives right above First Avenue says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends. Maybe. (O.S.) No Im not going up there. (to Elaine) Harold and Manny. Im not going. Boys boys. Oh Jerry. I slid the rent under your door Harold. Did you get it? Yeah yeah... Hey Jerry would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment? (in Spanish) You cant give him anything from there! I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalkers things. (in Spanish) You offered them to him. (to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. Its a good thing her rent was overdue. Shed be rotting up there for a month. She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died? Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didnt have her wig on. It was horrifying. (in Spanish) Harold Come on hurry up! (to Manny) Whats the matter with you? Im talking! So Jerry you know anyone who needs an apartment? Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine? Oh yeah I like her. She always says hello to me. Its not promised to anybody? Cause shed take it in a second. Well Manny wanted it for his brother but he got deported. (in spanish) What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration. Whats the difference? Its true! So its okay? I could just tell her she can have it? Sure sure. Shes getting a bargain too. Its only four hundred dollars a month. (in Spanish) Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more. Okay... Okay! Hey Harold what do you think? Manny look. Kramer put mousse in his hair. (in Spanish) It looks worse. (not understanding him) Hey thanks. What was that all about? (coyly) Oh nothing important. Whats going on? What is that look? What look? Nothing. Somethings going on here. I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide. Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up. Oh Elaine. You know the way I am  rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure it hurts sometimes to give and give and give... Would you please? What would you say if I told you that... Told me what?! ...I got you an apartment in this building. (dumbfounded) No. Yes. No. Yes. You didnt. I did. You got me an apartment in the building?! I got you an apartment in the building. How did you... Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me? No. She died. (thrilled) She died?! She died. She died! And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month! Get out! Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?! Four hundred a month. And Ill be right upstairs? Right upstairs. Right above you? Right above me. Oh were neighbors. Ill be here all the time! All the time. (overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh this is going to be great! All the time. The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like youre always making a movie. You mess up somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. Youre out somewhere with people Gee you look pregnant.. are you? Cut cut cut cut cut thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again. People think about what youre saying! Thanks see you later Donna. What happened to you? You cant believe what I just did. What? What did you do? I could tell you what I did but you wouldnt believe it. Its not believable. What did you do? How could I have done that? Done what? I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. Shes going to move in. Elaines moving into your building? Yes. Right above me. Right above you? Yeah. Youre gonna be neighbors. I know. Neighbors. Shes right above you? Right above me. How could you do that? Cause Im an idiot! You may think youre an idiot but with all due respect Im a much bigger idiot than you are. Dont insult me my friend. Remember who youre talking to. No ones a bigger idiot than me. Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building? Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos? Shes right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building Im gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar. Youre doomed. Youre gonna have to have all your sex at womens apartments. Itll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage. But I need the home bed advantage. Of course. We all do. Come in for two minutes and sit with me. I was just in there. Its embarrassing. Oh whos gonna know? They saw me walk out. Two minutes. My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you dont make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life. My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted. So is there any way out of this Elaine thing? Tough. You know the water pressures terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower. I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray. If they were fanatic about showers they might. For that rent shed take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to. Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy disgusting coffee shop corned beef hash. Isnt that child abuse? Id like to have a kid. Of course you have to have a date first... Remember my friend Adam from Detroit? Yeah the guy with the flat head. Hes a cube. Anyway he got married six months ago. He told me ever since hes been wearing a wedding band women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes. Yeah Ive heard that about wedding bands. I wonder if thats really true. That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know Kramer has his fathers band. Hed loan it to you. Thanks a lot. Ill give it back to you in a week. You know I dont even know why youre fooling around with this ring. Ive been telling you get yourself some plugs. Or a piece. Im not doing that. Oh man. You know youre crazy. Youre a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for? No Ill put half a can of mousse in my head like you. I told you I dont like these sponges theyre too small! I want a big sponge! You cant pick up anything with these! Theres no absorption! Boys boys. Hi Jerry. Hello Jerry. (in spanish to Harold) You tell him. Okay (in spanish to Harold again) You tell him. Your friend cant have the apartment Jerry. What? Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I dont want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (in spanish) Why are you telling him its my fault? Because its true! Why shouldnt I tell him? Hey hey. I understand. Youre businessmen. (in spanish) Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment. Oh now he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars well give it to her. Well thats a lot of money. But if thats the way its gotta be thats the way its gotta be. You know I used to think that the universe is a random chaotic sequence of meaningless events but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things. What happened to you? Religion my friend thats what happened to me. Because I have just been informed that its going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs. (jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesnt have five thousand dollars! Of course she doesnt have five thousand dollars! So she cant get the apartment. Cant get it. So she doesnt move in. No move. So you see its all part of a divine plan. And how does the baldness fit into that plan? (to the intercom) Elaine? Yeah. (to George) All right this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend Im disappointed. Youre going to really see me being a phony now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room. Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham! Cause you know I love Elaine. Of course you do. But you know... not in the building. Really I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me. (to someone in the hallway) No Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) Good morning good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? Oh and before I forget I have the checks for the first month last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account. Well... theres a little bit of a problem. Oh I know. Theres a weak shower spray I know. Ive already thought about it and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies. Uh no uh someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. Im sure theyd just as soon give it to you but youd have to come up with that money. Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars. I know. (disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars? I have no idea. (to Elaine) Hey my new neighbor! Im not moving in. What? They want five thousand dollars now. So okay uh whats the problem? I dont have five thousand dollars. Cmon you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry you dont have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on. Yeah well I didnt- Is that something you want to borrow? No thats too much money to borrow. Loan her the money. You can afford it. She doesnt wanna borrow the money. Oh cmon. Shell pay you back. Whats five grand between friends? Of course Id pay you back.. Yeah so whats the problem? Who said theres a problem? Hey see He said hed loan you the money. Well Jerry it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that? Thats okay. He doesnt care. Well you know money can sometimes come between friends. Get outta here. Let me think about it. Whats to think about? I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it. (to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Wheres she gonna get five thousand? She doesnt have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. Shes gone. Then you come in Why dont you loan her five thousand? What do you care? Youve got five thousand. Give her five thousand! You didnt want her in the building? No I didnt! Well then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh look maybe she wont take it. I mean she did say that she was gonna think about it. People dont turn down money. Its what separates us from the animals. I still dont understand what the problem is having her in the building. Let me explain something to you. You see youre not normal. Youre a great guy I love you but youre a pod. I on the other hand am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward uncomfortable even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldnt understand. Because Im a pod? Ill take it! Hi Elaine. Oh hi Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George and this is Jerry. Hi Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment. So youre Elaines hero. Yes its my lifes work. There are so few true heroes left in this world. Yeah my wife couldnt make it today. Shes got something with her mother... Who knows whats going on with her. Dont let any one kid you its tough. Well better load up on some carbos before the race. Oh the marathon is great isnt it? Oh yes. Particularly if youre not in it. I wish we had a view of the finish line. Whats to see? A woman from Norway a guy from Kenya and twenty thousand losers. ...yeah my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. Im tellin you its one thing after another. Is she here? Uh no no shes working. What does she do? Shes an... etymologist. You know bees flies gnats. W-What about you? I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. Its great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway shes a very luck woman. Enjoy the race. (calling after her) But.. Hi Stan. Joanne. Jerry this is Joanne and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me. Hi how are ya? Hey Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building! Well Jerry itll be nice having a close friend nearby. (no amused) Fantastic. She can pop in whenever she wants. I know. She doesnt even need to knock! Its tremendous. Anytime of day. Im in heaven. Oh Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment. Oh hi. (calling to someone) Bob this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment. Im sorry I dont see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges you move the cape whats so hard? So uh are you really married? Because Ive actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women. (laughs) Youd have to be a real loser to try something like that. Thats too bad because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. Hey everybody! Here come the runners! (to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off huh? Oh I wouldnt quite say that. Really? From a distance you seemed to be coming on to her. Im a guy  it always looks like that. Because I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will yknow... cramp our styles? Nah... Because I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody it could get a little uncomfortable. But as long as youre okay with it its fine with me. Ive never been able to be with just one person. I can however carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. Its a shame youre married. Umm Im not. Its just a sociological experiment! Please... You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didnt take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot. Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please a little respect. For I am Costanza: Lord of the Idiots! (yelling out the window) Youre all winners! But suddenly a new contender has emerged... George I didnt sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. Im just going to be honest. Thats all... Yes Im nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. Itll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) Ill call you back after I talk to her... Bye. Well its all taken care of. Everythings cool. What? Whats cool? Elaine. What are you talking about? I just found a guy whos willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment. You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand? Cash. Who would pay that much? Hes in the music business. Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer my God man! This is beautiful! I think Im in the clear here. Elaines not moving in. I dont have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. Im golden! Well occasionally I like to help the humans. Wow. Youre right. That is loud. Its just unbelievable. They rehearse all the time? All the time. Ive been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I cant live like this. I dont know what Im gonna do. Im heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Cant you do something? Im not going up. It stinks up there. Manny... (in Spanish) Theyre allowed to play until eleven oclock! Im not the one who said eleven oclock. He makes up his own rules. Boy too bad. If I was up there youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse. Oh I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing) I dont know. What do you do when a neighbor is making like a lot of noise at three oclock in the morning? I mean can you knock on someones door and tell them to keep it down? Youre really altering your whole self-image. I mean what am I Fred Mertz now? Whats happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. Theres a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh... shh... shhh... shhh... Doesnt work cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me. Some people you cant shush in a movie theater. Theres always that certain group of people isnt it? Theyre talking and talking and everyone around them is shushing them and shushing them. They wont shush. Theyre the unshushables.]
10,2,6,[(to Kramer) To the right. That took awhile. Dont get up. Id like to help but my neck.. So how long has it been in the basement? Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida but they didnt want it. They told me to get rid of it but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And its been sitting down there for three years until he saw it. (to Kramer) All right so just take what you want and lets get it out of here. Whats in it? Grandpa clothes I cant wear em. You want these? Knee socks. You dont wear knee socks. No go ahead. Look at this place. I cant wait to get it cleaned. I know someone wholl do it. Shes good. Shes honest. No Elaines got this writer friend from Finland Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school and hes suppose to do it. Students cant clean. Its anathema. (explaining) They dont like it. How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation? Now this I like. Wait a second. (George gets up and heads for the statue in Kramers hands.) I cant believe this! Let me see this. Wait wait wait... Let me just see it. Come on... Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God its exactly the same! What? When I was ten years old my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And one day I grabbed it and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing MacArthur Park and I got to the part about Ill never have that recipe again and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life aside from seeing my father naked. Cmon George. I saw it first. No Kramer. I have to have this statue. No I got dibs! What? No dibs! I need this statue. Cmon give it! Spread out spread out you numbskulls. Why dont you just settle it like mature adults? Potato man! No no no potato man. Inka-dink. Okay...yea well uh start with me. Yeah good good. Inka-dink a bottle of ink the cork fell out and you stink. Not because youre dirty not because youre clean  just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine... And you are it! What?! Wait a minute. No no no. What are you doing? No no oh oh okay. Hes out. I get it. No no no no Im It. I win. No hes It. He wins. It is good. Do over  start with him. No no no come on Kramer. Now you got the socks. All right you can have it. (Kramer tosses the statue to George.) (not expecting the statue to be thrown) Dit. Okay Im gonna take the suit and the shoes and the hat. All right cmon. Lets go. Hey I look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. I cant believe I won at Inka-dink. Come on lets go. Yea. Arent you gonna take it? No no no I dont want to carry it around all night. Ill pick it up later. (to Kramer) What about your stuff? Oh uh well - okay. All right lets go. Hey you know you owe me one. What? The Inka-dink.. You were It. Its bad? Its very bad. Well if they dont let you be my editor on this book Ill go to another publisher. Its that simple. You told them that? Of course. (excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you. (to Rava) So wheres this boyfriend of yours? I cant wait much longer. Ive got a flight. Oh probably caught in traffic. Or maybe hes dead. So what do you write childrens books? Thats Ray. Ah greetings greetings and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava my love. Elaine my dear friend. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah my liege. A pleasure to serve you. All right... And we have to get back to work. I gotta get to the airport. Your palace shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival Sire. The uh toilet brush is under the sink. I dont really feel that comfortable with a maid either because theres that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know youre sitting there on your sofa and they go by with the vacuum Im really sorry about this. I dont know why I left that stuff over there. And thats why I could never be a maid because Id have an attitude. Id find them wherever they are in the house Oh I suppose you couldnt do this? No dont get up let me clean up your filth. No you couldnt dust. No this is too tough isnt it? He really did an amazing job. Look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid! (Jerry opens refrigerator.) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups! Come here look at this. (He gets on his knees and points.) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there?! He must be like Rubber Man! Theres no Rubber Man. Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? Theres Elastic Man... Plastic Man... Im leaving. Where are you going? To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript. Oh wait. Ill go with you. Elaine he Windexed the little peep hole! (to Rava) So the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief!

Well this is an unexpected surprise  and delight! The once and future king of comedy Jerry the First gracing our humble abode. Rava were in the presence of royalty. Hey Ray listen you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment. But I didnt just clean your apartment. It was a ritual a ceremony a celebration of life. Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere? The water is boiling. Are you having tea? Yes. Jerry? Jerry! What? (from the kitchen) Ray would you give me a hand? Yeah Im coming! I think thats the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house! What statue? I had a statue! You have a statue? I never saw a statue. My grandfather gave me a statue! Since when? Whats the difference?! Thats the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off! Do you take sugar? Uhh... no. I cant believe it! This guy ripped me off! Do you realize what youre saying? Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house! Lemon? Uh... sure/yeah.. Are you sure? Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure. Ninety-nine percent sure?! Ah sweet elixir. Its fragrant nectar a soothing balm for the soul. Ah those are the pastries Ray take care of that Im going to get Elaine the manuscript. Ah the pastries! Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence. Coincidence? This guys in my apartment and then just by coincidence he has the same exact statue in his apartment? I never saw the statue. I had a statue! What should I do? I dont know. Ill call Kramer. He can check my house. Oh Jerry dont blow this for me. Dont worry. (whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!... Its Jerry!... Jerry!... From next door!... Never mind where I am!... Yes Jerry Seinfeld!... Ma I told you just dip the bread in the batter and put in right in the pan... Okay bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Rava) My mother. She forgot how to make French toast. You know how mothers are. My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. We never heard from her again. I hope shes rotting in an alley somewhere! My moms down in Florida. Shes got uh one of those condos. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there? I love these pastries. You know in Scandinavian mythology the pastries were the food of the gods. Listen uh I just remembered... Im... uh getting a facial. Oh see you tomorrow morning. How about dinner? No I dont eat dinner. Dinners for suckers. Uh huh... Yeah... Okay thanks anyway... Bye. Nope the cop says its my word against his. Theres nothing they can do. Lets go get him. Yeah right. We cant just let him get away with this. Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know its missing and he took it! And of all things to take! I left my watch tape recorder stereo. Hes crazy. You wanna go get him? Well then if hes crazy you should just forget it. Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mothers making her roasted potatoes! George do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book? Who is this Rava? I say we get him. No! Let me just call him. Ill call him. (Jerry picks up the cordless phone. He points to the rotary phone on the coffee table. Kramer George and Elaine struggle for it.) Hello Ray?... Hi Ray this is Ravas friend Elaines friend Jerry... The King of Comedy right. Listen you know that statue on your mantle the one with the blue lady? (He covers the reciever and yells at Kramer and George.) Would you shut up?! (to the phone) Yeah you dont want to talk about it over the phone?.. You dont want Rava to hear?... Yeah I understand... You know that coffee shop near my house Monks?... All right tomorrow... One o clock... Great okay bye. All right look look look. Lets say he stole it. Oh he stole it! Cmon you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it? No. I thought you said one oclock. Relax hes late. Hes always late. Its part of his M.O. Remember dont take any crap. Yeah yeah. Dont worry about it. Ill be right here. Thats comforting. Shh. Hes coming. (to Ray) Ray? Oh Jerry. I cant believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you couldve got me into? Well I didnt... Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue. (muttering to himself) I wonder why. Well just give it back and I wont say anything. Give it back? Yeah. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What is he talking about? Im talking about the statue. Yeah me too. Give it back to whom? Me. Yeah him. You? Yeah. Me. Im not getting this. You already got it. Ray I had a statue in my house. You were in my house  and then I saw it in your house. What are you saying? What am I saying? Take a wild guess. Are you saying I stole your statue? What a mind. Well I... I cant believe what Im hearing. I cant believe what Im hearing. I cant believe what Im hearing. For your information I got that statue in a pawn shop. Pawn shop? A pawn shop? Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning peoples apartments. Cleaning them out. Oh excuse me... Look Ray you were the only person in my house. Whats behind this? Its Rava isnt it? Again with the Rava. You want her. No shes a little too cheery for me. Shes from Finland for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?! I know Finland. Theyre neutral. Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way? No I actually find you quite charming. A bit verbose at times... Oh I find you so charming. You wuss. (to George) Did you call me a wuss? What did you say? I said luss. Im at a luss. I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it. Thats not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table repeatedly.) You know maybe its not that bad an idea. And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But unfortunately the guy retired and moved to Singapore. Singapore?! Do you hear this? If you really want maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore and have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over. Thats it! Thats it! I cant take it. I cant take it anymore! You stole the statue! Youre a theif! Youre a liar! George... Who is this? Im the judge and the jury pal. And the verdict is guilty! Whats going on here? GUILTY! Your friend is crazy. Oh Im crazy! George george... Ive got to get going. I have a class. Oh ho! Class huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something pal. I called the registrars office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar! Well thats because Im registered under my full legal name Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name. You mean alias. You are starting to make me angry! Well that was bound to happen. (to Jerry) I hope you think about what youve done here today. And if you want to call and apologize you know where to reach me. Hey Ray. Yes? How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle! Nervous? Why should I be? Yeah. Right. Your notes are very insightful. The book is great. Did you go out last night? No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable. They all are. Was Jerry? I cant remember. You know Ray is very upset over these accusations. Oh well Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved. So you think he stole it?! Well you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence... I admit nothing! Will you put that cigarette out please? Well I mean he was in the apartment and then its gone and its in your apartment. Maybe you think were in cahoots. No no. But it is quite a coincidence. Yes thats all: a coincidence! A big coincidence. Not a big coincidence. A coincidence! No thats a big coincidence. Thats what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences! No there are degrees of coincidences. No there are only coincidences! Ask anyone! Are there big coincidences and small coincidences or just coincidences? Well?! Well?! Will you put that cigarette out?! Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) Its just like Ray said. You and Jerry are jealous of our love. Youre trying to destroy us. Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere? Ma will you stop?... Its just a statue!... How is it my fault?!... It was stolen. I didnt even touch it this time... Okay fine... I dont see why this should affect to potatoes!... Okay... Goodbye. (George hangs up.) She doesnt react to disappointment very well. Unlike me. Im not happy about this. Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window? Theres just no justice. This experience has changed me. Its made me more cynical more bitter more jaded. Really? (casually) Sure why not. Well how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook. Cant you talk to your boss? I did. He loves Rava. Worse he loves Ray. And he didnt think youre funny at all. (talking to himself) Im not happy about this. Well perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice.. Yeah hell have my parents. (from the other side of the door) Police! Open up! Police? Freeze mother! Hey. Shut up. Spread em. I said spread em! (looks around) Youre in big trouble son. Burglary grand larceny possession of stolen goods... and uh uh... murder. Murder?! Shut up! Keep em spread! Just make love to that wall pervert! I think you have me confused with somebody else. Is your name Ray? Yeah. Yeah youre the punk Im looking for! Hey hey are you a cop? Yeah Im a cop. Im a good cop. Im a damn good cop! (On that line Kramer points to Ray and Ray turns back to the wall. Kramer heads for the door.) Todays your lucky day junior cause Im gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity and youll be sorry. You got me? Got you? I dont even know what the hell youre talking about. Good good. Lets uh keep it that way. All right all right. Whats the big hubbub bub? Kramer I cant believe it. Oh youre my hero! Yeah. Kramer what did you do? Well lets just say I didnt take him to Peoples Court. I feel like a huge weights been lifted off my shoulders. I... I... I feel happy! Kramer I dont know how to thank you! Well Ill think of something. People are going to steal from you. You cant stop them. But everybody has their own little personal security things. Things that they think will foil the crooks you know? In your own mind right? You go to the beach go in the water put your wallet in the sneaker whos gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They cant get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel they move on.]
11,2,7,[(on the phone) Ha ha she was great. You dont want to know. Hey Breaky remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. (laughing) Get this...I got it all on video. (laughing) Thats it. This is it. Im done. Through. Its over. Im gone. Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you. (laughing) You think youre an important man? Is that what you think? You are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at you. Youre nothing! You have no brains no ability nothing! (knocking object over on desk) I quit! nan Hey. nan Hey. nan Boy I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last night at three oclock in the morning to tell me hes going up onto the roof to kill himself. nan Well whatd you say? nan I said  Jump. Well hes been threatening to do this for years. I said  Look if youre gonna kill yourself do it already and stop bothering me. At least Id respect the guy for accomplishing something. nan Whats his problem? nan No job. No women. nan He called the right guy. nan Well what am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live for? Why should I lie to him? nan All right Im leaving. I going to the laundry. nan Why dont you use the machines down in the basement? nan Fluff and Fold. The only way to live. (snapping fingers in tune with words) I drop it off. I pick it up. Its a delight. nan How bout if I put a few things -- Wait a sec. I dont wanna do -- Well youre going over there. nan I dont wanna mix in everything! My guys dont know your guys. You cant just lock em all in the same machine together. Theyll start a riot. nan Have you ever met my guys? nan No. I cant say as I have. nan Well! nan All right. Put em on top. nan Ah! nan Oh beautiful. nan This stuff on top is my friends. Could I get it done in a separate machine? nan Ill have to charge you for another machine. nan Whatever it costs. In fact I would prefer it if the machines are not even touching each other. Because something could you know jump across. nan Guess what. nan How did you know I was here? nan Kramer. Guess what. nan I dont know. nan I quit my job. nan Get outta here. nan I couldnt take it anymore. nan You can have this on Monday. (hands Jerry a ticket) What happened? Levitan? nan I go in to use his private bathroom everybody uses it and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the mens room in the hall. Well (laughing) I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. Its disgusting! nan You and your toilets. nan I snapped! It was the last straw. (sighs) So what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else in real estate? nan Nobodys hiring now. The markets terrible. nan So what are you gonna do? nan I like sports. I could do something in sports. nan Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity? nan You know like the general manager of a baseball team or something. nan Yeah. Well that - that could be tough to get. nan Well it doesnt even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game. nan Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments. nan What about that? nan Well they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that are you know in broadcasting. nan Well thats really not fair. nan I know. Well okay. Okay. What else do ya like? nan Movies. I like to watch movies. nan Yeah. Yeah. nan Do they pay people to watch movies? nan Projectionists. nan Thats true. nan But you gotta know how to work the projector. nan Right. nan And its probably a union thing. nan (scoffs) Those unions. (sighs) Okay. Sports...movies. What about a talk show host? nan Talk show host. Thats good. nan I think Id be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone even told me once they thought Id be a good talk show host. nan Really? nan Yeah. A couple of people. I dont get that though. Where do you start? nan Well thats where it gets tricky. nan You cant just walk into a building and say  I wanna be a talk show host. I wouldnt think so. nan Its all politics. nan All right. Okay. Sports movies talk show host. What else? nan This could have been a huge mistake. nan Well it doesnt sound like you completely thought this through. nan (sighs) Guess not. What should I do? nan Maybe you can just go back. nan Go back? nan Yeah. Pretend like it never happened. nan You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it never happened? nan Sure. Youre an emotional person. People dont take you seriously. nan Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened. nan Never happened. nan I was just blowin off a little steam. So what? nan So what? Youre entitled. nan Im emotional. nan Thats right. Youre emotional. nan Never happened. nan Never happened. nan To me the most annoying thing about the couple of times that I did work in an office. Is that when you go in in the morning you say Hi to everyone and for some reason throughout the day you have to continue to greet these people all day every time you see them. I mean you walk in morning Bill morning Bob how you doing? fine Ten minutes later you see him in the hall How ya doin? Every time you pass you gotta come up with another little greeting. You know you start racking your brains you know you do the little eyebrow Hey You start coming up with nicknames for them. Jimbo. How ya doin? nan What are you doing here? nan What?

I want you outta here. nan I dont know where youre getting this from. I....youre serious arent you? Oh (laughing) you see? You see you just dont know my sense of humor. Dan dont I joke around all the time? I wouldnt say all the time. You cant win. You cant beat me. Thats why Im here and youre there. Because Im a winner. Ill always be a winner and youll always be a loser. nan  Ill always be a winner and youll always be a loser. This is what he said to me. nan Well so thats that. nan No. Thats not that. nan Thats not that? nan No. nan Well if thats not that what is that? nan Ive got some plans. I got plans. nan What kind of plans? nan Whats the difference? nan You dont wanna tell me? nan Im gonna slip him a mickey. nan What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What are you Peter Lorre? nan You dont understand. Hes got this big party coming up. Hes been looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole thing. nan What if you destroy him? nan No. No. No. No. No. Dont worry. Its perfectly safe. I researched it. Hell get a little woozy. He might keel over. nan Well wha - what does that do? Big deal. nan This is what they would do in the movies! Its a beautiful thing! Its like a movie! Im gonna slip him a mickey! nan Youve really gone mental. nan Nah. nan Where are you gonna get this mickey? I cant believe Im saying mickey! nan I got a source. nan You got a mickey source? nan And Elaine is gonna keep him busy. nan Elaine? How did you rope her into this? nan I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife. nan She knew that. nan But she didnt know he doesnt recycle. nan What is the point of all this? nan Revenge. nan Oh the best revenge is living well. nan Theres no chance of that. nan Did you get your laundry? nan Yeah. nan Whats with you? nan He jumped. nan What? nan Yeah. Newman jumped. nan Did he call you last night? nan Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. nan What did you say? nan I said  Wave to me when you pass my window. Whew. Did he wave? nan No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from across the street. Hes lying out there faking. See hes trying to get back at me. nan (realizing something) Oh my god! nan Whats the matter? nan (tearing through his laundry bag) Well on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh come on lets go. nan Where? Where? nan To the Laundromat. nan I never saw it. nan Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing? nan Hey you see that sign right there? (Points to a sign saying Not Responsible for Valuables Oh I see. So you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want? Youre not a part of society. nan Yea thats right cuz this place is my country and Im the president and thats my constitution. Im not responsible. nan So anybody leaves anything here you can just take it? You have a license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry? nan You ever hear of a bank? nan Come on. Lets go. nan No. You cant let him get away with this. nan Which one is he? nan Thats him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish. nan Oh yeah. I see him. nan Yeah. Hey thanks for doing this. nan Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison? nan This is by far the most exciting thing Ive ever done. nan Yeah. It is kind of cool. nan First time in my life Ive ever gotten back at someone. nan I cant believe were doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies. nan Thats exactly what I told Jerry! nan Really? nan Yes! (both laugh) God Ive never felt so alive! nan Maybe we should call this off. nan Come on. Whats the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in the washing machine. nan And whats gonna happen? nan Well itll gonna mix up with the water and then by the end of the cycle itll be a solid block! nan If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. Youre like Lex Luthor. nan You keep him busy. nan Whoa! nan You go over there - Yeah. nan You start flirting with him and Ill come by and while youre keeping him busy Ill slip it in his drink. nan Wouldnt it be easier just to punch him in the mouth? nan Come on! Theyre terrible. They got no infield. nan Oops! (bumps into Levitan) Scuse me. nan Yeah. nan Im gonna get some food. You want some? nan Nah. nan Hi. nan Hi. nan (sneezes) God bless you. nan Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank yous. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So thank... yoooou! nan (confused) Youre welcome. nan People dont say  God bless you  as much as they used to. Have you noticed that? nan No. nan (having trouble getting him to pay attention) So Im going to a nudist colony next week. nan (interested) Nudist colony? nan Oh yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah! nan (laughing) Id never been to a nudist colony. nan Oh really? Oh you should go. Theyre great. Theyre great. Of course when its over its - its hard to get used to all this clothing you know. So a lot of times Ill just lock the door to my office and Ill just sit there naked. nan Seriously? nan Oh yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. nan (whispering) Glenda can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat? nan (loud) What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats. nan (whispering) I cant explain. Its very important that I sit here. nan (loud) What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired. nan (whispering angrily) Okay. Okay. Fine. nan I cook naked I clean....I clean naked I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked. nan Who are you? nan Oh you dont wanna know mistah. Im trouble. Big trouble. nan (trying to divert Vics attention) What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? nan Do you think its effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle cycle? nan What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of temperament? nan What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must be something. What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks? nan I didnt realize it was a full box. nan (trying again with Glenda) Im gonna count to three. If you dont give up the chair the wig is coming off. nan I dont wear a wig. nan One... (Glenda seeing George is serious; gets up and leaves) No. No. No. No. No. I dont really have a phone. In fact I - I really dont have an apartment. I kinda sleep around. nan I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra. nan Hello Rick. nan Heh heh heh hey! Look whos here! nan Thats right Ricky Boy its me! nan You know something Costanza? Im a very lucky man. nan Oh! nan Ive always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap. nan Boom! nan You wouldnt believe it if I told you. In fact uh Im glad youre here. You know maybe Ive been a little rough on ya huh? nan Oh. nan Why should we let petty personal differences get in the way of business? I uh I want you to come back. (George is shocked) You can use my bathroom anytime you want. nan You want me to come back? Uh... Hey! How about a toast huh? Everybody a toast! nan Rick. nan Everyone I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr Properties. nan Uh Rick.. nan And all the people in this room (clears throat) that made that possible.. nan Rick. nan Id also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little shrimpy friend George Costanza who although he didnt really have a very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal Ill never know. But hey what the hell huh? Weve always enjoyed his antics around the office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this? nan Drink up. (Levitan takes a drink) I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor or something. nan Well to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree. nan Yeah. Thats true. nan (seeing Jerry is with people) Oh. What? (Kramer hands Jerry an envelope) My God the money! The 1500! Whered you find it? nan It was in my laundry. nan In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys. What did we figure the damage on that machine would be? nan It was about 1200 bucks. nan Kramer! nan Oh! Thats Newman. (goes over to the window) Im on the roof! nan (yelling up) Well what are you waiting for? nan Elaine come on take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta pay this guy the money.. nan (talking to nobody) I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy. nan You wanna shoot some pool tonight? nan I cant. Im goin to a movie. nan (talking to nobody) Nah. Its probably a union thing. nan People like the idea of revenge. Have you ever heard the expression The best revenge is living well Ive said this in other words it means supposedly the best way to get back at someone is just by being happy and successful in your own life. Sounds nice doesnt really work on that Charles Bronson. kinda level. You know what I mean those movies where his whole family gets wiped out by some street scum. You think you could go up to him Charlie forgot about the 357 what you need is a custom-made suit and a convertible. New carpeting french doors a divan. Thatll show those punks.]
12,2,8,[(Germanic) Look Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system incinerating. Like flaming globes Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah ha ha ha.. What do you got a cucumber? Yeah so what? Youre bringing in an ouside cucumber? They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber. (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I cant read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night I wrote this down I thought I had this great bit. No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Dont-mess-with-Johnny. Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show? (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny Jerry? Let me see that. (Studies the note) Hey wheres Kramer? I dont know. Thats like asking Wheres Waldo? (Still holding the note) I think Im having a heart attack. I dont think thats it. Im not kidding. What does that mean? I think what hes trying to say is that hes having a heart attack. Oh hes having a heart attack. Tightness.. Cmon. Shortness of breath.. Oh this is ridiculous. Radiating waves of pain.. I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure and not watch it. There was nothing else on. Oh the left arm.. the left arm. (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year and ate like an animal for two weeks. Why cant I have a heart attack? Im allowed. So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital? Manhattan Memorial less of a line. Ill call an ambulance. (Exits) Is everything alright? Well just take a check. (She leaves the check. George in all his cheapness cant help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the.. George! Ooohhh... Argghhh.. Are.. are you okay? Ooooooohhh.. Im George.. George Costanza.. Ive never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know they never gave me any ice cream. I always felt that- Shut up! Well? What do you think? Salami salami bologna? (In a hurry) Oh your friends fine. He didnt have a heart attack. Ill be in - in a few minutes. (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters Georges room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey how ya doin buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic? No no thanks. (Still going along with the practical joke) You know I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have? Oh sure my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket. Well you know I was thinking - if things dont exactly work out.. Well it wouldnt fit you. The sleeves are too short. No I tried it on. It fits good. Well I didnt really think about what I was gonna do with all.. Well you know.. (Reluctantly) Well okay. Oh and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis? Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey wait a second.. Well its not like wed be bumping into you. I dont know.. you and Susan Davis? You know if your future was a little more certain.. Okay go ahead. Call her get married have babies have a great life.. What do I care? Im finished. (Really depressed) Its all over for me. In fact lets end it right now. Jerry kill me kill me now. Im begging you. Lets just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face. Well ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didnt think Jerry would actually do it) What are ya doing?! Whadya crazy?! Jerry! (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George and puts it back on his bed) (To Jerry) Jerk off. (Whispering) Theres nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. Hes fine. Hi George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment? Ill tell ya if I ever get out of here Im gonna change my life. Im gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga meditate.. Ill eat right. Calm down lose my anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine arent listening. He snaps) Hey is anybody listening?! (To Elaine) Uh hello. (To George) Uh Mr. Costanza? (Panicky) Uh yeah. You know Doctor I gotta tell you I feel a lot better. Well we looked at your EKGs ran some tests did a complete work-up. (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God Mommy! And you simply havent had a heart attack. (Relieved) I havent? Im okay? Im okay? Oh thank you thank you Doctor! I dont know how to thank you. (Sarcastic) Hey that was really fun George. Can we go home now? No actually wed like to keep him here overnight for observation just to be safe. Oh sure. Sure anything. Can you believe it? Theres nothing wrong with me. Well I wouldnt go that far. (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?! Have you ever had your tonsils taken out? My tonsils? Yeah when I was a kid. Well theyve grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too. Really? (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs) It happens. Yeah if youve been exposed to gamma rays. I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didnt have their tonsils. Thats interesting. Because no one in my family has their tonsils and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people. (Sarcastically) Well its like the Capulets and the Montagues. (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me! Anyway I strongly recommend they come out. What? You mean with a knife? Yes. With a knife. You know snip snip. Anyway youd be completely under you wouldnt feel a thing. And when you wake up you can have some ice cream. (Angry) Yeah thats what they told me the last time. Think about it. (Turns to leave but runs into Elaine) Excuse me. (Flustered) Oh Im sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves) Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body. Hey. Hey. Boy they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food sandwiches a salad bar.. Its like a Sizzlers opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So how did you have a heart attack? Youre a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh they love to do zipper jobs. (Trying to shut him up) Kramer. The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly boom! Next thing you know you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage. Kramer George didnt have a heart attack. No? Thats good. I have to have my tonsils taken out. Oh man.. No.. George we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! Theyll kill ya in here. (Trying to calm George down) Its routine surgery. Oh yeah? My friend Bob Saccomanno he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah routine surgery.. now hes sittin around in a chair by a window going My name is Bob .. George whatever you do dont let em cut you. Dont let em cut you.. Well what should I do Kramer? Well for one think dont listen to him. Ill tell you what to do Ill tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor Tor hell fix you right up. Hes a herbalist a healer George. Hes not just gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind. Eckman? I thought he was doing time? No no hes out. He got out. See the medical establishment see they tried to frame him. Its all politics. But hes a rebel. A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George you want to take care of your tonsils you do it in a hospital. With a doctor. Hes holistic George. Hes holistic. Holistic.. that sounds right. George you need a medical doctor. (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital? Well an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno four grand. Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge? First visit? Thirty-eight bucks. Oh yeah? Holistic.. thats what I need. Thats the answer. So how do you like the way I talked you into comin down here? Dont flatter yourself my friend. Im here strictly for material and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think youre nuts though. All I know is Ive been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? Im thirty-three years old. I havent outgrown the problems of puberty Im already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. Ive never had a normal medium orgasm. (Jokingly making fun of George) Ive never had a really good pickle. Besides whats it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks? (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please? Sorry. What month were you born? April. You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait. Really? Do you use hot water in the shower? Yes. Stop using it. ..Okay. Im off hot water. Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery. Yes yes I am. (Blows into Georges face) I think we can help you. See unfortunately the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs customers. And they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery. (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face? No. You know I am not a business man. Im a holistic healer. Its a calling its a gift. You see its in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain sick. You see that insures good business. Youre not a patient. Youre a customer. (He thinks this the audience can hear his thoughts) And youre not a doctor but you play one in real life. (Still on the hot water) What about shaving? (To Jerry) Youre eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over and touches Georges face) I guess so. (Feeling Georges face) You see you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis adenoiditis is in Chinese medical terms and invasion of heat and wind. (Again we hear his thoughts) Theres some hot air blowing in here.. You know I lived with the Eskimos many years ago and they used to plunge their faces into the snow. (Once again still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm? Too much dairy? You really think Im eating too much dairy? ..The tongue.. yes the tongue.. or in medical terms the glossa. Its a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body and the root.. You see its covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile.. Uh-huh. (Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. Its a special concoction. It contains crampbark. I love crampbark. Cleavers. Cleaver I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car. And some couchgrass. Couchgrass and crampbark? You know I think thats what killed Curly. Go ahead drink it George. Excuse me Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. Youre in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I cant read. I was wondering if- (Takes the note then laughs when he reads it) Oh yes.. yes.. Cleveland 117 San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry) Go ahead drink it George. (Takes a sip) Hey its not too bad.. (In a state of hysteria) Im an eggplant! Im an eggplant! Im a minstrel man! (To Assistant) I didnt take your Chuckle man! I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one and the yellow one and the red one is missing! I dont even like Chuckles! (To Assistant) Maybe he doesnt like them. Thats possible. My face! My face! Get me to the hospital! I want that Chuckle! You hear me?! (To Assistant) Ill get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle? (Angry to Driver) Pull over! Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?! Yeah! Youre gonna fight? Now?! Im a mutant! (To Driver) Hey let me drive. Come on man. Pull over! Alright! Im gonna mess you up man! (Pleading) Really gentlemen please. My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?! Im gonna kick his ass. (To Assistant) Hey you have keys? You cant leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency! All this for a Chuckle. Whats a Chuckle? Its a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors. You see taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces. Can you let go of my tongue now? What? Let go of my tongue! (Lets go) Oh sorry. Well I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing? I was going to kiss you good night. A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech I dont think so. (Leaves) You just cant leave him out there. I told him I was gonna mess him up. Well can you call him an ambulance? I told him I didnt take his Chuckle. I dont eat that gooey crap! hey watch the road! Watch the road man! (Turns back facing Kramer) Hey man you want some of what he got?! Watch out! How ya doing? (George nods) Cant talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey howd you get the plastic one? (George raises his eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So hows life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? Whats that? ..So how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like five six thousand?.. (George signals that its more) Well live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing? Oh poor George. Oh Im sorry but I cant stay long. I dont want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh please come on.. it was nothing. Hey check the TV. (Germanic) Its just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system incinerating. Like flaming globes Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah ha ha ha.. (Pulls the note out of his pocket) Thats it! Thats it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! Thats my note! thats what I thought was so funny?! ..Thats not funny.. Theres nothing funny about that. Shut up! Aaahhhgggg! I have a friend whos a hypochondriac always thinks hes sick - never is. And they you have another type of person always thinks theyre well not matter how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better in my life. Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact its probably only a matter of time before a heart attack you know becomes like a head ache. Well just see people on TV going I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands gesturing bigness) ..but I gave myself one of these. Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and its gone!]
13,2,9,[What are you doing? All right all right. Whats the matter with that? What about that one? Robert Vaughn The Helsinki Formula? He was good in Man From Uncle. Guess whose birthdays comin up soon? I know Im having my root canal the same week. Oh right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey look at naked people. No I dont wanna see the naked people. Been a while? I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone but it was a long long time ago. I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter. I remember that its a good thing. Someday I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine) What? What? What was that look? What look? The look you just gave me. I gave a look? Yes. What kind of look? I know that look. Then what was it? Why should I tell you? Well youre the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are. Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So... What? What about the look? I dont know. You got something on your mind? No. Things pop into your head. You? Things occur to me from time to time. Yeah me too. Well you cant expect to just forget the past completely. No of course not. I mean it was something we did. Probably about what? Twenty-five times? Thirty-seven. Yeah we pretty much know what were doin in there. (Points to bedroom) We know the terrain. No big surprises. Nope. What do you think? I dont know. What do you think? Well its something to consider. Yeah. I mean lets say we did. What if. Is that like the end of the world or something? Certainly not. Why shouldnt we be able to do that once in a while if we want to? I know. I mean really what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) Were in there for a while. We come right back out here. Its not complicated. Its almost stupid if we didnt. Its moronic. Absurd! Of course I guess maybe some little problems could arise. We there are always a few. I mean if anything happened and we couldnt be friends the way we are now that would be really bad. Devastating. Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship) And that would be good. (Points to bedroom) That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed. Yeah we just wanna take this and add that. But of course wed have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something. Huh. For example now I call you whenever Im inclined and vice versa. Right. But if we did that we might feel a certain obligation to call. Well why should that be? Oh I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that. Beautiful. Lets make it a rule. All right sir. Now heres another little rule. Yeah. When we see each other now we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes when people get involved with that they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I dont see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that. Okay okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional! Well now were gettin somewhere. What about the kiss goodnight? Tough one. Youre call. Its brug-wa (?). Fine. Well. Well. You ready? Ready. So think you can handle this? Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf) Hey. Hey. Got the paper? Not yet. No paper? I havent been out yet. Well whats taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh well yeah... (He exits) Whats the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land or was he just restricted to water? No I think I saw him on land a couple times. So hows the job situation goin? Still lookin. Its pretty bad out there. What about you? Nothin much. I slept with Elaine last night. Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major. I thought youd like that. Oh this is huge! I know. All right okay. Lets go details. No I cant do details. You wha? I cant give details. No details? Im not in the mood. You ask me here to have lunch tell me you slept with Elaine and then say youre not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I dont have a job I have no place to go. Youre not in the mood? Well you get in the mood! All right okay. Were in the apartment watching TV. Where are you sitting? On the couch. Next to each other? No separated. Time? Around eleven. Okay go ahead. So shes flipping around the TV and she gets to the naked station. Oh see? thats why I dont have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house I would never turn it off. I wouldnt sleep I wouldnt eat. Eventually firemen would have to break through the door theyd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right all right. So youre watching the naked station. And then somehow we started talking about what if we had sex. Boy these are really bad details. It pains me to say this but I may be getting to mature for details. Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me. Well. Ill tell you though. It was really passionate. Better than before? She mustve taken some kind of seminar or something. This is all too much. So what are you feeling? Whats going on? Are you like a couple again now? Not exactly. Not exactly. What does that mean? Well weve tried to arrange a situation where well be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands out of his seat) Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? Its impossible. It cant be done. I think weve worked out a system. Oh you know what youre like? Youre like a pathetic gambler. Youre one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking hes gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack. No this is very advanced. Weve designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by avoiding all of the relationship pitfalls. Sure all right. Tell me the rules. Okay. No calls the next day. (To himself) So youre havin the sex next day you dont have to call. Thats pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead. You ready for the second one? I have tell you Im pretty impressed with the first one. Spending the night. Optional. No you see? You got greedy. No thats the rule. Its optional. I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is theyre not happy if you dont spend the night. It could be a hot sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) Youre not going anywhere. I think youre wrong. I hope I am. Is this yours or the roommates? The roommates. Would she mind? She keeps track of everything. Well thats too bad cause Im takin it. Thanks. Well guess Ill get going. Oh. Well I got that root canal tomorrow morning. Itll be easier if I go home. Fine go away. I dont understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) Im getting the impression theres a problem. Just go. Im having surgery tomorrow. Oh surgery. Youre going to the dentist. But you said it can be very serious. Okay so fine. Go. What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional. Yeah its my house its my option. It has nothing to do with whose house it is. Oh of course it does. (Elaines roommate Tina enters) Hi. Hi. Oh really? Uh Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second? What are you doing? I cant go if youre mad. Im not mad. You seemed a little mad. No no. Jerry Im fine really. Its okay. So youre okay with everything? Definitely. Are you? Definitely. Well goodnight. Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) Whatre you doing? What? Rules. What about jewelry? Thats very nice gift. No no. I have to be very careful here. I dont want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night. Maybe Ill get her some jewelry. No no. You cant get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend you have to spend half. What am I supposed to get a bazooka? You dont understand. Im in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her shes going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it. What does she need? Maybe theres something that she needs. I think I heard her say something about a bench. A bench? What kind of a bench? I dont know but she mentioned a bench. What like at a bus stop? I dont know. Like a park bench? I have no idea. Who puts a bench in their house? Forget the bench. I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How bout a music box? No too relationshippy. She opens it up she hears that Lauras theme Im dead. Okay what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you but if you wanna get serious perhaps youd be interested in someone like this. Nice looking fellow. What about candle holders? Too romantic. Lingerie? Too sexual. Waffle maker. Too domestic. Bust of Nelson Rockefeller. Too Gubernatorial. (?) Lets work on the card. Maybe you wont like it. Oh how could I not like it? Of course Ill like it. You could not like it. Just the fact that you remembered means everything. Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh the card. (She opens) Cash? Would do you think? You got me cash? Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good? Who are you my uncle? Well come on. Thats $182 right there. I dont think thats anything to sneeze at. Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl a great pal and more? (Kramer enters) Hey. Oh Elaine. Im glad youre here. Stay right there. Im gonna be right back. (He exits) Pal? You think Im your pal? I said and more. I am not your pal. Whats wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present) Oh what is this? You got me something? Yeah. Open it. Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated) Thats pretty good huh? Great. Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it. Well goody for you. Oh yeah Im very sensitive about that. I mean when someones birthday comes up I keep my ears open. So whatd you get her? 182 bucks. Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? Thats like something her uncle would get her. (Reading card) Think where mans glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend. (To Jerry) Yates. Oh Kramer. (They embrace) Could you excuse us please? What? Were talking. Oh the relationship. (He leaves) You know we never had one fight before this deal. I know. Never. Ever. We got along beautifully. Like clams. It was wonderful. A pleasure. So I think we should just forget the whole deal and go back to being friends. I cant do it. You what? I cant do that. You mean its... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh boy. Hmmm. What do you want? This that and the other. Oh sure. Of course youre entitled. Who doesnt want this that and the other? You. (Starts to correct then realizes) Well... Those birthdays. I told you. Theyre relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever a birthday will always bring it out. I never should have made up those rules. What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity? It cant be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class. You know what this means? I cant see her anymore either. Why? Its break up by association. Besides shes mad at me anyway because of my birthday present. What did you end up giving her? 91 dollars. Sorry about that. So whatre you gonna do? Well if I call her theres no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it. So maybe this should be it. Could be it. She seems like an it. Shes at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me hes a sculptor they live in Vermont... Wed have to kill him. Wed get caught Id get the chair. Id go to prison as your accomplice. Id have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people. Plus you know what else. You better call her. Hey. Hey. You got the paper yet? Yeah. Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey you done with that? No. Well youre not reading it now. All right you can take it. But I want it back. Oh yeah. So ah whatre you guys gonna do today? Ah this. And that. And the other. Boy I really liked the two of you much better when you werent a couple. (He exits)]
14,2,10,[(Shocked) Shes pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh see there is no justice. Shes the performance artist right? (Sarcastic) Yeah performance artist. Shes a real performer. A real trooper. Whats her husbands name again? Chip? Kip? Skip? Todd. Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) Hes a Kennedy. No hes not. Cmon. Hes a third cousin or something. By marriage. Oh by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on bad directions. That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life. Oh pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful intelligent woman. What you dont think I can attract beautiful intelligent women? Thin ice George. Thin ice.. (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece shell give birth on stage. She stopped performing. (Again sarcastic) Oh what a huge blow to the culture. (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini. She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her performances. Oh and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity? God! Shes cooking dinner for God! Shes yelling and screaming and the next thing I know she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red shirt. It was an accident! Oh yeah sure accident right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then for the rest of the show Im sitting there with chocolate all over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. Im boiling - Im fantasizing all the things Im gonna say when I see her. And later finally backstage when I talk to her Im a groveling worm. What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods? (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot. And then then then she leaves with somebody else! Never even never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I was dirt. What ever happened with the shirt? I still have it. The collars okay. I wear it under sweaters. I dont know what Im gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower. Asked you? Youre not going to do that are you? anyone else never. But Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason I seem to want her approval. Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower. Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me. (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker. Oh would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! Its all so boring.. She doesnt deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemarys baby! (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem though. Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing. See I was gonna give the shower in my apartment.. But? My roommate has Lyme disease. Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome? She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. Its like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease. How did she get Lyme disease? I dont know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury Connecticut. They still do that play? Its a classic. With all the nudity? I guess. She mustve rolled over on a tick during the love-in. (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye! Explain to me how this baby shower thing works. What do you wanna know? Well I mean does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence? Rarely. Theres no hazing of the fetus or anything is there? No. When is this suppose to be? Saturday. Saturday?.. Well I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. Theyre not gonna bust up my apartment or anything are they? Ill take full responsibility. You wont regret it. Cause Ive seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn and boom! And entire buffet is swept off the table. Someday before I die mark my words - Im gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. Ill never be able to forgive myself until I do. And if you do? I still wont be able to forgive myself - but at least it wont be about this. What are you doing this for? Look at you.. Quiet. Im trying to get a picture. But you dont have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house. (Pleading) Leave me alone. Its a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?! Im not getting illegal cable! Oh so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? Theyre gonna be in court for years. No I read in the paper.. (Sarcastic) Oh oh the paper.. Well they might hook us up again. Oh God youre so naive! All the cable companies care about is the Big Mammoo. (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh look at you! Youre banging things.. Pathetic. Just wasting your life. Im offering you fifty-six channels - movies sports nudity. And its free! For life! Stop shouting! Youre ruining the reception. Can you hear yourself? Can can do you know what youre saying?! What youre suggesting is illegal. Its not illegal. Its against the law. Well yeah. (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just just hold this. Can you hold that? (Holding the rabbit ears) Look will you at least let me bring the guy over? Hes an amazing man. Hes a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. Hes like the Sakharov of cable guys.. Hell slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs Jerry. Slugs for the subway. A real human rights nut huh? Yeah. Hes intense man. I dont know. What if I get caught? Oh youre not gonna get caught. Look let me get him. Man its the nineties its Hammer time! Come on just let me get him. You know why dont we wait? Because Im going out of town tomarrow. Tomarrow okay. No problem. Yeah youll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back. (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV sirens are gonna go off. Theyre gonna track me down like a dog I know it.. No no now look now Jerry Jerry its no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year.. (Pauses thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in. You wont regret it. (Jerry mutters some more Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerrys gonna be a cable boy a cable boy a cable boy.. Mr. Steinfeld? Seinfeld. Were with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up? My cable hook-up? What about it? Its been illegally installed Mr. Steinfeld. It has? Ive been out of town. How did you know? Jerry I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning. Youre in serious trouble Mr. Steinfeld. Wait a minute. Wait a minute hold on! Were just patsies. Were just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian guy is the guy you want. Mr. Seinfeld Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover. No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerrys gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry cupping Jerrys head in his hands) Cable boy cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?.. Excuse me. Can I get something to drink? Im afraid not. Whats with this airline? What are you cutting out the drinks now? No sir. Were flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. Were making an emergency landing. (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again? My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see. Im not afraid of flying although many people do have fear of flying and I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because human beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel and they go This isnt right. I shouldnt be doing this. I dont belong here. Sounds like a rough trip. Oh fire engines ambulances all along the runway. And then when we landed safely they all seemed so disappointed. So the college cancelled the gig? Well there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again. (Modestly) Forget it. No really.. an airport run. Its nothing. Hey its one thing if I asked you Could you do me a favor? ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesnt suspect anything - yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend. (Joking) You know if Richie Brandes did this Id be suspicious you know. Hes always got some ulterior motive. (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive. Oh wait a minute. Wait a minute. Dont take the bridge.. Get off here. We cant go back to my place Elaines having the shower. (Obviously knows that but pretends he doesnt) What tonight? Now? Yeah yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright its no big deal. Well just go back to your place. My place? NO no no. I hate my place. I dont wanna go back to my place. You want to get a bite? Yeah I would. Its just you know I just ate a whole pot roast. Well so what should we do? Shouldnt we at least drop off your bag? Red shirt! Red shirt! Thats the red shirt! (Nervous) What are you talking about? Youre wearing the chocolate shirt! I am? What a strange coincidence.. A - Ha! Nice try my friend but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning.. (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there. What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda? No Im gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years and Im gonna say Remember this shirt baby?! Well now its payback time! We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetzs mother used to live there. So wheres Todd? Up in Hyannisport. Oh my God Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?! (To Leslie) So whens your due date? March twentieth nine a.m. You know the time! Im having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor I might get psychotic. Leslie Leslie whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You dont hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop? (Takes a bite of food) Elaine who catered this Sears? (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here? Were putting in cable. The cable? No no no. Im having a party here. You cant do this now! Oh we have to do this now. Whos this guy? Which one? Both of the them. Oh theyre Soviet Cable guys. Okay.. Does Jerry know about this? Oh yeah.. its all authorized yeah. You cant! You cant do this now! Elaine do you know how booked up this guy is? Now if I send him away now its gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He wont like that. Alright. Just do it fast and then get out. (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look its gonna take a few minutes.. Then you and the gals can take a load off and watch something on Lifetime. And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her? (Boiling) What am I going to say?! Yeah. What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I dont deserve that kind of treatment! What you dont have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think Im some sort of a loser that likes to be abused and ignored?! Whos shirt can be ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like you! Youll never say that to her face. Watch me. (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah I eat the whole apple. The core stem seeds everything. (To Kramer) Kramer Kramer look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! Hes eating all the food! Yeah yeah. Well you know there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that youre not aware of. See in Russian the cable guy they got the whole run of the house. Yeah thats tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple? Kramer! (Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me.. What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend. The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard. I cant believe you told Kramer its okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry look look! Theyve eaten everything. Jerry what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town. Well Leslie sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason. (Speaking confidentially to George) George dont even think about it! Dont even dream about it! (Unconvincingly coy) About what? (Sticks his head out the door) Kramer Kramer Kramer.. Leslie. Yeah? George.. (She doesnt seem to recognize him) George Costanza. Hi. (Laughs) You I guess you dont remember me.. but we actually kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember? Vaguely. You took me to one of your shows.. And? And um it was quite good. In fact you even incorporated me into the show. Im not actually a performer. Although my parents felt I had talent.. Jerry?! (A woman angry at Jerry approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me? Im sorry I.. (Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesnt ring a bell Jerry? We had a date three years ago. You took me to one of your shows. (Stammering) Oh I I think I remember.. Told me you had a great time! Said youd call me the next day. Well Im sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your.. Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think Im some sort of poor pathetic wretch?! No I dont think that.. Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesnt deserve your respect and your attention?! Youre the one that doesnt deserve my respect and my attention! Youre the insignificant piece of dust! Actually I never had any formal training. I guess Id be better suited for improvs or something.. Thanks a lot! Im sorry you have to go. Yeah. I really have to be going. Alright listen Ive changed my mind about this whole thing. I dont want cable. Dont be a fool. You dont want? No I dont want. So just tell me what I owe you for your trouble.. (Confers with his assistant then) Four hundred dollars. (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty! Im going.. obviously. Oh Leslie I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know I had no idea.. Elaine you know I was watching you tonight and I realized something. Youre just like you were in college. (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) Like you were in college? (Comes back and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Lets go! (Sheepishly to Elaine) Ill be right back. (Leaves) (Defiantly) Im not paying four hundred dollars! I dont even want the thing. What are you going to do?! Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet I want them all.. is that irony? Why cant I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding but.. it didnt stop. Alright I said I had a good time and Id call but who takes that literally? (Pops his head into Jerrys apartment) Hey come on over Dr. Zhivagos on cable in five minutes.. Im making popcorn! (Leaves) What do you do at the end of a date when you know you dont want to see this person ever again for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you say? No matter what you say its a lie. Ill see you around. See you around. If youre around and Im around Ill see you around that area. Youll be around other people. You wont be around me. But you will be around. Take care now. Did you ever say that to somebody? Take care now. Take care now. Because Im not going to be taking care of you. So you should take care now. Take care. Take care. What does this mean? Take off! Isnt that what you really want to say? Take off now.]

Excuse me are you gonna be very long? Lashbrook 4! So did I do a terrible thing? You mean lying to your uncle? I couldnt have dinner with him. Plan 9 from Outer Space one night only the big screen. My hands are tied! You know its a public phone youre not supposed to just chit-chat. Jerry get menus so when we sit down we can order right away. Cant look at a menu now I gotta be at the table. He knows Im waiting. He sees me. He just doesnt wanna look. Everythings gotta be just so with you doesnt it? Hey I offered you those cookies in my house. Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things. I just cant believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity? What kind of a world do we live in? What? Theres a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair striped shirt? Ive never seen her before. I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy. Oh Excuse me. Im sorry. Didja see that? Those people look theyre getting a table. Well maybe they were here from before. No no no they werent here before. Excuse me are you going to be much longer? I have to make a very important call. Find out whats going on! Excuse me didnt those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of them. Yeah. Whats your name? Seinfeld. No no they were here before. Keckitch(sp?) 2! Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think theyre so special because theyve been chosen. Its enough to make you sick. Boy you are really hungry. Hey! If anything happens here can I count on you? What? If we decide to go at it. Yeah I wanna get into a rumble... I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit. Its all so coordinated the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate this guy. Im gonna faint... George who is that woman in the stripes? I dont know her. She looks so familiar. Ya know its not fair people are seated First Come First Served It should be based on whos hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebodys plate. Ill tell you what theres 50 bucks in it for you if you do it. What do you mean? You walk over that table you pick up an eggroll you dont say anything you eat it say thank you very much wipe your mouth walk away- I give you 50 bucks. What are they gonna do? They wont do anything; in fact youll be giving them a story to tell for the rest of their lives. 50 bucks youll give me 50 bucks? 50 bucks. That table over there the three couples. OK I dont wanna go over there and do it and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole like I didnt put mustard on it or something... No no tricks. Should I do it George? For 50 bucks? Id put my face in the soup and blow. Alright alright. Here hold this. Im doin it. I know this sounds crazy but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls. Ill give you 25 if you let me do it. What? What is she talking about? What did she say? What happened? Did you see that? What were you doing? I offered them 25 they had no idea... George the phones free. Alleluia. Excuse me I was waiting here. Where? I didnt see you. Ive been standing here for the last ten minutes! Well I wont be long. Thats not the point. The point is I was here first. Well if you were here first youd be holding the phone. You know were living in a society! Were supposed to act in a civilized way. Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no! Hey sorry I took so long. Oh thats OK really dont worry about it. How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? Im gonna walk around see what dishes look good. I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that? Yeah well he probably bought it. So what happened with Tatiana? I shouldnt even tell you this. Come on... Well after dinner last week she invites me back to her apartment. Im with you. Well its this little place with this little bathroom. Its like right there you know its not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? Theres no... buffer zone. So we start to fool around and its the first time and its early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending... intestinal requirement whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know Im gonna have to stop. And as this is happening Im thinking even if I can somehow manage to momentarily... extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know Im going to need... This could only happen to you. So I finally stop and say Tatiana I hope you dont take this the wrong way but I think it would be best if I left. You said this to her after. No. During. Oh boy. Yeah. Wow! So...? So Im dressing and shes staring up at me struggling to compute this unprecedented turn of events. I dont know what to say to reassure this woman and worst of all I dont have the time to say it. The only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman and Im very sorry I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her to agree to see me again. Now shes waiting for me to call her and shes I hate this place. I dont know why we came here Im never coming back here again. Who is that woman?! Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before and they put it in front of you and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough. Shes off. (goes over to the now available public phone) Jerry talk to that guy again. What am I gonna say? Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that were late. Hey what stinks in here? Well Ive been looking for a better place. Better place... Want a table? No just bring me a plate and Ill eat here. Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on I give you a table. Excuse me... weve been waiting here. Now I KNOW we were ahead of that guy he just came in. Oh no Mr. Cohen always here. Hes always here? What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh Mr. Cohen very nice man. He live on Park Avenue. Where am I? Is this a dream? What in Gods name is going on here?! Shes not there. She left. She mustve waited and left because those people wouldnt get off the phone. Didja leave a message? Yeah I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding stocky man with glasses. I better tell him Im expecting a call. Oh Jerry here comes that woman... Where do I know her? Hello Jerry! Heeeeyyyy... How you doin? How is everything? Good good good... Whats goin on? Oh working hard. And you? Oh you know working around same stuff doing... whatever.

Hes gonna tell his wife his wifes gonna call my mother. Oh this is bad you dont know the chain reaction of calls this is gonna set off. New York Long Island Florida its like the Bermuda Triangle. Unfortunately nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt my aunt to my mother my mother to my uncle... ...My uncle to my cousin my cousin to my sister my sister to me. You shouldve just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. Its just a movie. Just a movie?! You dont understand. This isnt Plans 1 through 8 from Outer Space this is Plan 9 this is the one that worked. The worst movie ever made! Hey I got news for you if were making this movie we gotta get a table immediately. Alright OK. Lets stop fooling around. Lets just slip him some money. In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money? Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time you just slip him 20 bucks. 20 bucks? Isnt that excessive? Well what do you want to give him change? Its more than the meal! Oh come on Well divide it up three ways. Alright. 77 (points at himself) 6. Im not gonna eat that much! Im counting your shrimps. OK Whos gonna do it? Oh no I cant do it. I-Im not good at these things I get flustered. Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby I almost got arrested. I guess its you Jer. Me? What about you? Oh I cant do that its a guy thing. The womans movement just cant seem to make any progress in the world of bribery can they? Give me the money. Hows it going? Very busy. Boy we are REALLY anxious to sit down. Very good specials tonight. If theres anything you can do to get us a table wed really appreciate it. What is your name? (he turns the page over the money) No no I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page) Yes we have sea-bass dinner tonight very fresh. Here take this. Im starving. Take it! Take it! Dennison 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready. No no no I want that table. I want that table! Oh come on did you see that? What was that? He took the money he didnt give us a table. You lost the 20. Well how could he do that? You didnt make it clear. Make it clear? What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright let me get the money back. Your name? Seinfeld. Yeah Seinfeld 4! No no no you see the girl there with the long hair? Oh yes yes. Very beautiful girl very beautiful. Is your girlfriend? Well actually we did date for a while but... its really not relevant here. Relationships are difficult. Its very hard to stay together- Alright listen alright. How much longer is it gonna be? Oh. In about five ten minutes. So? There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy. So when are we gonna eat? Five ten minutes. We should have left earlier. I told you. I dont see any way we can eat and make this movie. Oh well I have to eat. Well lets just order to go well eat it in the cab. Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab? Well eat it in the movie. Oh who do you think youre going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there? Well what do you suggest? I say we leave now we go to Skyburger and we scarf em down. Im not going to Skyburger. Besides its in the opposite direction lets just eat popcorn or something. Cartwright? I cant have popcorn for dinner! Cartwright? I have to eat! So they have hotdogs there. Oh movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor. I cant go anywhere I have to wait here for Tatianas call. Let me just check. Excuse me Im expecting a call. Costanza? Yeah I just got a call. I yell Cartwright! Cartwright! just like that. Nobody came up I hang up. Well was it for Costanza or... Yes yes thats it. Nobody answered. Well was it a woman? Yeah yeah. I tell her you not here she said curse word I hang up. She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her. Whos Cartwright? Im Cartwright! Youre not Cartwri- Of course Im not Cartwright! Look why dont you two just go to the movies all by yourselves Im not in the mood. Well me neither Im goin to Skyburger. So Youre not going? You dont need us. Well I cant go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic remarks to strangers? Eh I guess Ill just go to my uncles. Should we tell him were leaving? What for? Lets just get out of here. Seinfeld 4? Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean the proof of that is cannibalism. Cannibalism what do they say I mean theyre eating and you know This is good who is this? I like this person. You know I mean I would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very deep sleep you know what I mean? I would think youd be like (pretending to wake up) Who is that? Whos there? Whos there? Is somebody there? What do you want? What do you want? You look hungry are you hungry? Get out of here!]
16,2,12,[Do you want some of mine? Take some of mine. Why do I get pesto? Why do I think Ill like it? I keep trying to like it like I have to like it. Who said you have to like it? Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant thats all you hear - pesto pesto pesto. I dont like pesto. Where was pesto 10 years ago? (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look but Jerry stops her) Ill bet you hes gettin hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age wearing a baseball cap ten to one - plugs. (Elaine turns to look at the man trying to make it sound like they arent talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah plugola. (To Elaine) Oh one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute. Thats a tough minute. Its like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work. I dont understand why he couldnt take a cab. Who? Elaine is having a houseguest. Shes picking him up at the airport tonight. A guy? (Slightly embarrassed) Yes a guy. Hes from a.. Yakima right? Seattle. Everybodys moving to Seattle. Its the pesto of cities. So..? (To Jerry) You tell him. Well from what I can piece together our friend here met a gentleman. Ed. Who was in town on a business venture and um.. ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on. So they went out a few times but apparently when the fellow returned home he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily. On some people. Oooh. So hes coming in to stay with her for a week. It was just gonna be a weekend but then somehow it became a week. What happened? Oh the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle. Sorry to the disturbance. (Joking she snobbishly says) Im never eating here again. (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining room doorway) I think the busboys in trouble. Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didnt do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?! I said I would never eat here again.. But I I.. he had to know I was kidding. (Casually buttering a roll like hes the innocent one) I didnt say anything. I cant believe it. Hes going! Hes fired! Oh I said it in a kidding way. I didnt know hed get fired. (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) Hell probably kill his family over this. What if hes waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?! (Again joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards em. Was it my fault? Was it my fault? (Doesnt have a care in the world) ..Maybe Ill try that pesto. Look I feel bad for him too but hell get another job. I mean lets face it its not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of grueling interviews. (Eating a sandwich) Oh like you really know busboys. Oh like you do. Hey at least I was a camp waiter. (Scoffing) Camp. It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me. Elaine? (Through intercom) Yeah. Busboys are always changing jobs. Thats the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs. Then why dont you try and get him another job? Id love to but I dont know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins. I dont know if you people are aware of this but I am one clever chickadee. What? Did you get the busboys number? His phones been disconnected but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys please? How did you get all this? Does the word charm mean anything to you? No. (George grabs his jacket) So now youre going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts. (Putting his jacket on) Id like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didnt mean to get him in trouble. You youre going now? Yeah I want to see if theres anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe Ill hear of something. Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) Youre not going? I would but I have to pick up Ed at the airport. I just dont think you should go alone. Cant you wait till after my set? Itll take to long. Take the K-man. A little support.. (Unsure) I dont a.. Take me where? Where? Look I really appreciate your coming but if you wouldnt mind - try not to say too much. What am I gonna say? I dont know. Well Im not an idiot. Certainly not. Then were cool. Yeah.. yeah were - were cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh Im sorry to bother you I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope Im not interrupting anything. Its just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I just want you to know that I didnt intend for that to happen. (Patting George on the shoulder) Hes a hell of a guy. This is a guy I know.. Kramer. &iquest;Habla espanol? (To himself) Oh my God. Si. &iquest;Como se dice.. waterbed? (Interrupting) Anyway I just wanted to let you know Im really sorry that happened and if I can help out in any way Ill certainly be glad to do that. (Pause) Well I guess thats about it. You got anything to drink? &iquest;Agua? Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going. Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink) Hurry up. (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic) His cats gone. (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look) ..You know cats run away all the time. You know my aunt she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again Antonio I cant even begin to say how deeply deeply sorry I am about everything. The job the cat.. (A lamp breaks) the lamp. The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah. (Hands Antonio a card) Heres my card. Im in real estate so if youre ever looking for something bigger something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesnt move) You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door the broken lamp falls to the floor) (On the phone) George stop worrying about this guy. It wasnt your fault.. Come on hes not stalking you. Hey. (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesnt even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) Thats Elaine. (Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again. Its been a week. Its up to the cat now. (Into phone) Kramer says its up to the cat now. (To Kramer) Itll be on your conscience. Oh? How do you figure? (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) Cause youre the one who left the door open. Why was I in charge of closing the door? (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay to Kramer) Cause you came in after him! So! (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So the last person in should close the door! Let me talk to him. (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) Hes calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up) Eds downstairs. CAn I have the car keys? No hello? Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now lookit you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems? Guarantee? ..Hey its a car. Because if theres even the slightest chance of any problem at all I dont want to take it - because if I dont get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life Im gonna kill him and everyone who tries to stop me. (Jokingly asking) So did you have a nice week together? I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping? Theres no ping. Why are you so wacky? Jerry you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasnt even done anything! Its the situation. Hes a wonderful guy but I hate his guts! So you two been uh.. No! I told him Ive been having my period for the last five days! Im sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But Ive only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think Ive taken care of everything. Ive confirmed the plane reservation. Ive checked the weather.. Whats your airport route? Ive got it all mapped out - Im taking the tunnel. ..What about the Van Wyck? I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut. Oooh. Now lookit this plane leaves at 10:15. Were getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time right? You still using that old alarm clock? Oh no no. I bought a new one today. Its got everything - its got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes a hand comes out and slaps you in the face. Flying doesnt make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when youre flying when youre getting on the plane if you miss that plane theres no alternative. On the ground you have options. You have buses you have taxis you have trains. But when youre taking a flight if you miss it thats it. No airline goes Well you missed the flight we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? Its not a direct cannon you have to change cannons after you land. (Imitates cannon operator) Im sorry where you goin? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh Dallas? Alright wait a second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. Thats about Dallas. Texas anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net immediately because we shoot the luggage in right after you. (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didnt go off! (Shakes him) Its 9:15! Youre gonna miss the plane! Its 9:15! 9:15? Yes! 9:15! (Going back to sleep) Well never make it. Ill leave tomarrow. Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No now now! Lets go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet throws it on the bed and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed! Can I shower? Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?! I gotta shower. Ill feel dirty all day. Forget the shower! The showers out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going? The kitchen. The kitchen?! Ive got a bag of cashews in there. Theyre not making it! Lets get your pants on! Whats the big deal if we dont make it? Ill just go tomarrow or the next day. No! You have your ticket! You have to go now! Ill never make it. Dont say that! But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. Thatll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane. Shut up and pack! And what if I dont make the plane? Youll have already left. Then what will I do? Youre talking too much! Wheres my sweater? What?! My brown sweater. What? What sweater? My brown sweater. You didnt bring a brown sweater. I brought a brown sweater. Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers and grabs a brown sweater then packs it) You got a brown sweater! Thats not mine. I cant take your sweater. Its brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers and dumps them into the suitcase) What are you doing?! NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think thats it. (Zips up the suitcase) My shoes. You packed my shoes. Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes werent invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase she grabs it from him then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Lets go! Anywhere in the city? Anywhere in the city - Ill tell you the best public toilet. Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth? Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - shell give you the key. Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth. (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall the Met. Magnificent facilities. (Slow as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than Ive ever gone before and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no ones ever beaten the Van Wyck but gentlemen I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadnt been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs. ..The busboys coming! The busboys coming! The busboys coming? You dont mean here? Yeah. I just buzzed him in. Hes on his way up.. Hes coming up?! (Moves to the door) Ill check you out later. Where are you going? Im the one he wants! Hes coming to settle the score. (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. Theres no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game. No hes not going to do anything. I guarantee it. Oh the hell with it. Let him kill me. I.. Antonio. In here! (Nervous his voice cracks) Hey Antonio. Hows it going? Three nights ago a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded killing five people in my section including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired that night because of you and your thoughtless stupid insensitive remarks it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again) (Trying to be modest) Ah come on.. (Into the intercom) Yeah? Its Eddie. Hes coming up. (Buzzes him in) Hes coming up.. And that very same night of the accident while looking for Pequita I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making before - and when I returned to the apartment Pequita perhaps frightened from the explosion had miraculously returned. Well but now I must go for today I am starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you thank you thank you all. (Leaves) Hey watch were youre going. You almost knocked my head off! Hey why dont you watch where youre going okay? Cause you bumped into me! Who do you think youre talking to pal? Hey get your hands off me! Go to hell! Hell get another job. Hes a busboy! It wont for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off. It was that fall down the stairs. Thats what did it. Thats not how it happened. Its when he fell on him with his knee. Oh that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks. So much longer? Till when - till he goes back to Seattle or till he can feed himself? (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess its not important. Take care of yourselves. (Leaves) I should probably get going too. If I dont feed Pequita by seven she goes all over everything.. take it easy. Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing? First of all I cant believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I cant really believe that we have boxing either. Its really kind of an amazing thing. To me the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why dont they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars drive around a bit have a little accident? They get out Didnt you see my signal? Look at that fender! ..Then youd see a real fight.]
17,3,1,[...And usually for lunch Ill have a salad and for dinner I eat whatever I want. What do you think the worst part of being blind is? Excuse me? You know if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would be? I dont know. I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? Id constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue. Well thats how my five-year old eats. Hes a very picky eater. You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania? No. He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog next thing you know she turns around boom hes gone. Oh. Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know whos crazy I could be one of these people. Have you seen any good movies? Who takes care of your boy during the day? We have a woman. Why? No no. Im just saying. She had references. Oh Im sure she did Im sure theyre impeccable. Im talking about the ones that forge `em. (about the massage)You know I think this is really helping. I dont live near here ya know! So shes giving me the massage and Im just making conversation. I dont like to talk during a massage. Neither do I but I do it for them. I figure theyre bored. Yeah I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I dont deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. Theres nothing to eat in here. Oh! I forgot to tell you-- Im in the middle of a story. Oh okay go ahead. Why dont you ever go shopping? Well its not like its a really funny story or anything. What happened? Well so she mentioned that she had a son and then for some reason I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted. Oh wasnt that terrible? Yes it was. Not even an apple. She doesnt want to hear that that was stupid. I know it was stupid. Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.) Hey I just said it was stupid. What about this leftover Chinese food? Take it. I cant believe you said that. Hey would you stop it already? So whatd she say? I dont know she actually seemed to get a little paranoid. (he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this ginger? I hate ginger. I cant understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.) I have a good masseuse you could go to. Nah shes really good and shes not just a masseuse shes a physical therapist. Theres a big difference. She uses the ultrasound its a real medical procedure. In fact if you get a doctors note its covered by insurance. Physical therapy is covered by insurance? Yeah. You dont have to pay for the massage? Not if you have a doctors note. So where do you get this note? Well Ive never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy the dentist. Right your friend Roy. Whats the name of this physical therapist? Ill tell you but dont ask her anything about her kid she a little off. And you dont have to pay. We have a three-oclock appointments. George and Elaine right? Right. Could you fill these out for me please? And um Elaine youll be seeing Julianna... (quietly) Ok. ... And George youll be with Raymond. Excuse me did you say Raymond? Yes. But uh Raymond is a man. Thats right. I cant get a massage from a man. Why not? What are you crazy? I cant have a man touching me. Switch with me. No I dont want the man either. Whats the difference youre a woman. Theyre supposed to be touching you. Hed just be touching your back. Hed just be touching your back too. No it could get sexual. I know. Thats the point. If its gonna get sexual it should get sexual with you. I wouldnt be comfortable. I would? What if something happens? What could happen? What if it felt good? Its supposed to feel good. I dont want it to feel good. Then why get the massage? Exactly! George? Yes? Im Raymond. (with a big smile) Hello.(with not a big smile) Are you ready? (smiling he looks at Elaine. She smiles back at him while looking all the way up there at the tall handsome Raymond.) ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the office. Really. Use to be a flight attendant. Oh boy. Ya know why dont ya open those pants its gonna be a lot easier that way. So what do you do? What? I said What do you do?. I-I dont know. You dont know what you do? Nah. Ohh-ho come on. Hey youre very tense. hu Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter). Okay just take off those pants now and Ill work the hamstring. Oh the hamstrings fine. But you wrote that it was tender. (holding the clip board) I wrote. Pfft *I* wrote. Ill check it out. (makes a notation on the form) Are you sure? Yeah take em off. (continues writing) How did you hurt this? I dont know. You dont know? No. But you just told me-- Korea. You hurt it in Korea? What? The hamstring. Korea. How? Hamstring. How did you hurt the hamstring? Hotel. Howd it go? George? No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay thanks anyway. Whats with you? A... ah... Yes A...? A man gave me... Yes a man gave you...? A man gave me... a massage. hu hu... So? So he... had his hands and uh he was uh... He was what?! He-he was uh... touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh) Thats a massage. And then I took my pants off. You took your pants off? For my hamstring. Oh. He got about uh two inches from... there. Really? I think it moved. Moved? It may have moved I dont know. Im sure it didnt move. It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it. Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know shift to the other side. No no. It wasnt a shift Ive shifted this was a move. Okay so what if it moved? Thats the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move. Thats not the test. Contact is the test if it moves as a result of contact. You think its contact? It has to be touched? Thats what a gym teacher once told me. Hey. Hey. I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut. Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts? Yeah. Joe DiMaggio. No Im sorry if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. Hes not sitting in Dinky Donuts. Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts. I dont even like to sit next to a man on an airplane cause our knees might touch. I cant see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts. Why cant Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else? He can have a donut Yeah. ...but not at Dinky. I dont even like to use urinals always been a stall man. Look Im tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) Im telling ya that was Joe DiMaggio. The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe hes in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctors note? Lets go see your friend Roy. I never said Id do that. What are you talking about thats seventy-five bucks! Im not working I cant afford that. I dont know how I feel about it. Oh what are you like a Quaker now? Alright alright. A stall man huh? (small laugh) All right -- (Gets up to leave) Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand) ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note and if you cant believe me its fine. He didnt say he cant. I mean if you feel funny about it at all. He doesnt feel funny. If he does. Do you feel funny? He didnt say anything. He feels funny. You dont have to do this. He knows that! Roy should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship? Oh can you be any more dramatic? Dont be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall) Holyfield. Hes a good friend of one of my patients. Hes got a hell of a body doesnt he? How would I know? Do you like him? What do you mean like him? Do you like him? I mean hes a good fighter and a nice guy but I dont like him. How come you dont like him? Why should I? What is the matter with you? Nothing why? You think somethings wrong? Am I different? So you want the notes? You dont have to really. Nah nah its ok. We should probably get one for Elaine too right George? (turns to George who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George? Well what about the week after? No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over) What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over) Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I cant believe this I make one innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and Im cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) Whats with you? What? Well you were too close to me I was all scrunched in there. Hey you scrunched me. I sat down here first. Hey I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again. Uh huh. Yeah. Joe DiMaggio? Joe DiMaggio you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied his every move. For example he dunks. Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?! Thats right. See now I know its not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker. Oh hes a dunker. Why couldnt he be a dunker? And nothing diverts his attention. Like Im uh you know I-I like Im sitting in there you know. And uh I start banging on the table you know to uh so that hell look up you know Like Im sitting there you know and uh *bang* (slams the table) You know *bang* He wouldnt move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused you see he can just block out anything thats going on around him. See thats how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits. So then what? Well then the waitress she comes up and she tells me to shut up or theyre gonna throw me out. Why didnt you just call out his name? What happened to you? These kids called me a Mary. A what? I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them and I tripped and I fell. Yeah you know kids they can be very perceptive. Hey George? What is this? (laughing Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really what is that? Hello? Oh hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. Hes under investigation for insurance fraud. ...just a man and not a freak Joltin Joe DiMaggio. Joe Joe. Go Joe... I told you. Told me what? I told you we shouldnt do it. He didnt say anything. Hes got a house a family they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes. Three notes? Yeah you me and George. You got me a note? Yeah. But I got my own note. You what? I got a note from my gynecologist. Whyd you do that? I didnt know you were getting me a note. Of course I was getting you a note. But you didnt say anything. Ohhh... Neither did you thats how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors. No Doctor-- Wait a-- How can you do that to your friend? Hes got a wife kids and a lot of other stuff. Oh yyyeeah. Hi Pam. Hello. Hello. I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy if um... Pam did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan... Hi. Hi Roy. How ya doing? Come on back I have a patient but shes under. I dont even know what to say. Me neither. I knew this would happen. Me too. I mean the whole thing its just... Tragic. Well its not tragic. No? No its... Unsettling? Okay. I mean what if the-- I hope youre both happy. (she turns and walks away) Im not happy. Me neither. Ive never been happy. I mean Im happy sometimes but-but not now. In college maybe. Those were fun times. Yeah college was fun. Yeah. Yeah. You know the whole practice is in jeopardy you know that? (she turns and walks away again.) Dont mind her. Oh please I love her. Ive just met her but Im very impressed. I cant understand Ive never had a problem with these notes before. Well whats the next move whats gonna happen now? Well nothing really as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story. What? The physical therapist? Why? She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem. How ya doing? Hi. Ah look I know I dont have an appointment but its really important that I talk with Julianna. Im sorry Mr. Seinfeld shes not in. Yeah I know shes mad at me but I really have to speak with her. I told you shes not here. You dont understand ah... Look you have to leave. Wait a second dont you-- Hi. Hi. Look I dont know what you think -- Please! --but you see let me just talk to you for a second see what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance-- I treated you so please just get out of the office! Cant you just listen to me? Run Billy! Run to the office and close the door! (to the receptionist) Call the police! The police? What is the --. Hi George. (stands there with a big smile) Hello. Raymond? Well I mean its only a six month probation its a slap on the wrist. Yeah I still dont see any dinner invitations forthcoming. Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden Ill be in the middle. Of what? And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say Get out of here! What do you want? You dont belong here! What do they do? They talk back. They go Hey George hows it going? I say Get the hell out of here! Hey its the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramers attention Elaine laughs) Maybe its time you got a different hobby. Man Ughhhh wwwheh.... I just came from Roys. I threw up from the gas. Did he say anything? No no hes fine. Oh my god its... Joe DiMaggio. (gasps) Where? Having a cup of coffee. And hes dunking! Yeah -- yeah. Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper... (quietly) yeah. ...here. You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please. Wait wait... hold on now wait wait... *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table startling Jerry Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you. What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry? I think its because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance. Were constantly buying shoes that hurt us pants that dont fit right. Men think Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store thinking its a shoe store and the salesman goes Just hold this guys hand walk around the store a little bit see how you feel. No obligation no pressure just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?]

No no she wasnt. You didnt get my papers? No I didnt. Well where is she? A mental institution. Why is it so difficult uncomfortable to be naked. Its because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like youre getting it together yeah yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when youre naked its like its so final youre Well thats it. (no movements) Theres nothing else I can do. Thats why I like to wear a belt when Im naked. Cause I feel it gives me something I know Im naked but you know (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be wouldnt that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot. A mental institution? You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoos Nest? They put those electrodes in your head. Its not really a mental institution. Its more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. Im Im sick over this. Who told you this: Her roommate. Ive driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution. My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large it had no effect. You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS! She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her. So what now? I dont know. Can we go out there? Where? Woodhaven. We could. Im very nervous about this. Ive never spoken to a mental patient before. My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin wheres the Pepsi wheres the Pepsi? I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it its good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those. Thatd be great. Theres no wrong answer. Potato Tuberculosis Blanket Leroy Grass Tuberculosis Oh boy. Here she comes. Oh my god. KRAMER! Hey. WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON. Listen uh you want some leftovers? I made some African food. Theres yambalas and uh sambusa. Kramer are you coming back to bed? Yeah yeah Ill be right there baby. Oh hi Elaine. (returns Elaines ear rings) What did you think of the coffee table? Its invisible. So is everything cool? or what? Yeah um you seem little bit dysfunctional. Well Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth. The Truth! You want The Truth? Who are you? Oh this is my friend Jerry. Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want? Want want? What could I possibly want? Uh I just came because I I heard so many nice things about you from George. George thinks Im pretentious. Pretentious? Who who isnt pretentious? Ha ha if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution ... uh obviously THIS isnt a mental institution. Youre just trying to take it all back because youre feeling guilty Im in here. No thats not it at all. Dont LIE George. Uh were cool. Everythings cool (to security attendent) Just chatting. Friendly. All righty no reason for us to uh raise our voices. I know what you said. You cant change that. What I said? I say stupid things all the time I cant go two minutes without saying stupid things. Its one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you when you come to one of these places what do you bring your pocketbook? You should be the one criticizing me. I Im lucky to even know someone like you. You mean that? Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile. Hes never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their uh pocket books. Like for example oh someone elses personal financial papers. Papers? Oh Jerry Youre the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So Id love to help you but Ill need the copies. there are no copies. So are you saying you want to continue seeing me? Who makes copies? The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple. Oh Kramer Here Kramer? No lets go to the couch... (on phone)Yes Im trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh it was a weave - ok uh then Ill come bye ok bye. Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt. I cant. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital. George? Im going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets in a burnt out building down by the docks Supposed to be good. Hey Are you going to the hospital now? Yeah I suppose I am. All right great great uh well share a cab. Youre going by 48th St. You can give me a ride. Hey Im getting in on that. You know youre chippin in. Youre going that way anyway! I was audited last year. At first I thought well IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe wont be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it you know. But its its bad. Its an ordeal. And they dont do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go Oh Im sorry thats another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!]
19,3,3,[(looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again. (searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here. Oh I think thats them! You what Ill do next time? Ill hide it so nobody can find it. Hi welcome greetings hugs etc. Welcome to Florida! Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug) Hey theres the old man! (hug) So what took you so long? Ahh we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place. I dont know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up. Whats the difference? You could have used our car. I dont wanna use your car. Whats wrong with our car? Nothing. Its a fine car. What if you wanna use it? We dont use it. What are you talking? We use it. If you were using it we wouldnt use it. So what would you do? Youd hitch? How much is a rent-a-car? I dont know. 25 bucks a day. What? Youre crazy. Plus the insurance. Oh I didnt get the insurance. How could you not get the insurance? Well pay for the car. Youre not paying for it. Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesnt) God its so hot in here. Why dont you put on the air conditioning? You dont need the air conditioner. So you have your speech all ready? Its not a speech. Do I have to make a speech? Of course theyre giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines. (ironically) Oh yeah that will go over real well with that crowd. (looking by the window) Ooh you have a lake? The lake isnt real. The lake is real. Are you kidding? They built the lake. But its real. Its water. Where are you going with those? Im gonna put Elaines stuff in here. Dont sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom. I cant take your bedroom. Im up at 6 oclock in the morning. I cant kick you out of your bed. We dont even sleep. Ma. But this is sofa bed youll be uncomfortable. (to Morty) What about you? Why should I be comfortable? (to Helen) What about him? Dont worry hes comfortable. Ill sleep standing up. Ill be fine. Will you stop? Yeah Ill just stay in here. (goes in the guest room) Jerry (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine wont hear) Jerry. You dont have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together. Na thats not such a good idea. Well I tought that... Not now. Shes right inside. (quieter) What happened? I dont know. We decided we dont really work as a couple. What does that mean? Well... (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering? Shh! Nothing nothing. Elaine... (still loud) What about her? (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) Weve tried all kind of arrangements but we cant seem to be friends when we sleep together. (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? Youve got plenty of friends. Hes an idealist. What the hell are you looking for? Im looking. Thats the point. I like looking. He likes looking. So look. But how long can you look? Im going for the record. You know your father wouldnt say so but hes really glad you came. Oh come on. This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association. Aha! So they arrived safely. (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris? Nice to see you. This is Elaine. Hi. Nice to meet you. So Jerry you came all the way down here for this? And scuba diving. Scuba diving? Whos going scuba diving? Were going scuba diving. Well be back in time. What do you have to go scuba diving for? For fun. For fun? Jack have some spong cake. No. thanks no. Jack is emceeing tomorrow. Hes in charge of the whole thing. So Jerry your mother told me youre gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow? I dont think so. No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket). What did you have? You had the minute steak? Yeah. Did you have a coke or what? I did NOT have a coke. Somebody had a coke. Oh I had a coke. And I had the scampi. So thats 17.10$ and the tax and the tip. All right. Make it 20 bucks. Its: 19.45$ Morty. (he gives him the check) 19.45$ ? See? You know your father. He cant get a write to the penny but thats why he was such a good president. What kind of pen is that? This pen? Yeah. This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space. Wow! Thats the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it? Oh it was a gift. Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work. Take the pen. Oh no. Go ahead. I couldnt Come on take the pen! I cant take it. Do me a personal favor! No Im not... Take the pen! I cannot take it! Take the pen! Are you sure? Positive! Take the pen! O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee boy! Jack what are you doing? Stop it! Jack we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice meeting you. Mmm nice to meet you. Thanks again. Come on! (to Morty) Shes adorable. (they leave) (as soon as the doors closed) What did you take his pen for? What he gave it to me. You didnt have to take it. Oh my God! Shes gotta make a big deal out of everything. He offered it to me. Because you made such a big fuss about it. I liked it. Should I have said I didnt like it? You shouldnt have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute) He could have said: Thank you I like it too and put it back in his pocket. He loves that pen. Oh come on! He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down how the astronauts use it. If he likes it so much he never should have offered it. He didnt think youd accpet. Well he was wrong. I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. Shell tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. Theyre talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument) So you want me to return it? Yes. Hes not gonna return the pen. Thats ridiculous. Hey I dont even want the pen now! Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didnt have a Coke. Ho ho ho! Here let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey it writes upside down. Come in. Are you O.K. in here? Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this? Its only for three days. Todays over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. Its one day really. Oh man. What is with this bar? Its right in my back. Its killing me. Oh you wanna switch? Im sleeping on a love seat. Ive got my feet up in the air like Im in a space capsule. I am never gonna fall asleep. Oh no dont say that. Youll jinx me. How can they not put the air conditioning on? Theyre nuts with temperature. This bar is right in my back! Its making a dent. How about that guy writing a check for 19.45? Im sweating here. Im in bed sweating. Its one day. Half a day really. I mean you substract showers and meals its like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers) Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly theres an abutment there. Then youre gonna merge over very quickly but stay on Biscayne. Dont get off Biscayne. You understand me? Stay on Biscayne. Youre going underwater? Yes. Generally thats where scuba diving is done. What do you have to go underwater for? Whats down there thats so special? Whats so special up here? Oh! Whats the matter? My back. What happened? That... That bed. The bar was right in my back. (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there. Then YOU would be hunched over. I dont even know if I can go scuba diving. You cant go? So stay home. You can go. Without you? Thats the whole reason you came down here. Dont go. You sure? Maybe you should see a doctor. Well stay in a hotel tonight. (whispering to Jerry) Yes! No well stay in there. Why dont you get a new sofa? Nobody uses it. Im buying you a new sofa. Oh Jerry dont talk crazy. Mrs Seinfeld please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on. Youre hot? Ive lost 6 pounds. I dont even know how to work it. I keep telling her its like an oven in here. Is everybody up? Hi. How are you? Hello Jerry. Evelyn this is Elaine. (with pain) Hi Evelyn. Jerry you got thin. Too thin? Oh stop worrying so much about how you look. So wheres the new pen? (everybodys surprised by this question) (Jerry scratches his head and acts like hes not sure what shes talking about) What? The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you. How did you know that? Blanche told me. Blanche? Thats some good pen. It writes upside down. The astronauts use them. What did Blanche say? I dont know. She said Jerry wanted the pen. I never really wanted the pen. He gave him the pen. Morty. Why you dont like the pen? No no I... Cause if you dont like it give it back to him. Is that what she said? Who? Blanche. What are you talking about? Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldnt do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) Youre giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we dont hear it.) Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER! (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it. All I said was I like the pen. How the hell do you work this thing? Maybe you shouldnt go tonight. No no I wanna go. But your back hurts. Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help. Oh oh O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want. No. Im fine. Youre not too cold? No. Dont be alarmed. Oh my God! What the hell happened to you? Im O.K. My capillaries burst. Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like? (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing? Having a good time! Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here? What happened to your eyes? Well I started to go under... With the instructor? Yeah and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets. I told you... Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) Whats she doing? Yoga? My back hurts. Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready. We got plenty of time. (to Jerry) What happened to you? I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool. Its from scuba diving. Whats there to see underwater? Listen M. Klompus it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen but I dont really need it. You what? I mean its a terrific pen but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack) Well I mean... Take it. All right! (he smiles and take it) You know Jack youve got a hell of a nerve taking that kids pen. Whose pen? His pen. This happens to be my pen. You didnt give it to him. What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it. Where do you come off with this crap? Listen do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it? You said you didnt want it! Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake! Then who the hell said you couldnt have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake? Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape! Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! Ive been looking all over for it! Dont worry about it! Ill give it back! I dont want it! I dont want it! You know Jack do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape and get the hell out of here! Listen do you think I give a damn? Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well thats it for them. What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of whats happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes? I have no use for either one of them. I dont even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands) Isnt he supposed to be the emcee? yeah hes supposed to be the emcee. Well. This should be a very interesting evening. (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers? Say astronaut. Say what? (laughing) Say what? (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills. Astronaut? Say it. Astronaut! (still laughing she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut! Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you? Oh God. (foreseeing an arms grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella) (to Leo) Uncle Leo. Hello! Morty are you nervous? What nervous? (to Jerry while hes grabbing his arm as usual) Whats with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson? Ive got a black eye. (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello. Oh uh Elaine this is my aunt Stella. (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA! (to Stella) Her back hurts. Humm... We saw you on The Tonight Show last week. I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didnt even let you talk. No no. You need some new material. Ive heard you do that dog routine three times already. (still with her imitation shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA! Listen you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you. What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department! You should read the letters hes written. Hes funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh heres Jack. We should sit down. (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. Im missing Golden Girls for this. (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison. (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen as you know every year Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan. (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him) Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work dedication and commitment and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry Helen and Morty. Even Elaine whos still druggy) (Morty complains again to Helen) Hes joking. His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents. (to Jack loud) Thats what you say. But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing) (loud) Tell them when you took my sons pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up) Dad! (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen and then he takes it back. Tell them about that! He gave it to me! Come on. Thats enough sit down! Im not sitting down! Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jacks pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! Im gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.) Jerry do your act. (in the microphone but to Helen) I cant. Nobodys even listening. Theyre all gonna leave. (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry) Who are you? (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes? (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class. Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut? Id rather have a bottle of scotch! (to Jerry) Do the dog routine. All I said was I liked the pen! (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA! You could aggravate it. I wouldnt go anywhere for at least five days. Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days? There must be some mistake. Im afraid not. (discouraged) Five days. Here. (to Jerry happily) So we have you for five more days! (to Elaine) Well theres really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be... Excuse me? Nothing. Good morning. Hi Evelyn. (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet? I dont think so. Because my nephew Larry could do it. Hes a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case. Well Ill ask him when he gets up. Oh and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one youll have to suck up to. Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! Its that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing? I was very comfortable. Morty Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out. Its in the constitution. (to the chiro) Who are you? Im a chiropractor. What are you kidding me? (to Jerry) Five more days? Well todays almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday were leaving. Its like two days really. Its like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers) Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. Theyll just sit there on the sun on the redwood benches washcloth on the head going: Close the door youre letting all the heat off the sun. Im trying to get a sweat going.]
20,3,4,[So Im on the plane we left late. Pilot says were going to be making up some time in the air. I thought well isnt that interesting. Well just make up time. Thats why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course when they say theyre making up time obviously theyre increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now my question is if you can go faster why dont you just go as fast as you can all the time? Cmon theres no cops up here nail it. Give it some gas! Were flying! Travelling of course is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty forty-five countries and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy and he was too young to take with me. But now I wont travel without him. Is he on the plane now? Oh yes. Yes hes in the hes in the baggage compartment. I dont know why they wont let him sit up here with me. Hes a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you do you have any pets? Uh just my next door neighbor. Youre missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible. Howbout picking up their you know. You find that enriching? Whats the matter? Oh Im feeling a bit queasy. My dog. What about my dog? Jerry? Huh? How you feeling? Would you take care of Farfel? Farfel? The dog? The dog?? Im sure its only for a day or two. But you know what if you know? Give me your address and phone number Ill call you. The dog? Let go Farfel! Let go gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do? Well its only been three days Im sure hes gonna call. STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what Im dealing with here Ive got a wild animal in the house! Hes deranged maybe hes got rabies. I can get lockjaw. If only. Look at this place. Hes going everywhere I cant go out of the house at night. I havent performed in three days. Thisll be my first night out of the house since I got back. Hey when you walk him do ya... Do I what? Do you pick it up? Yes I pick it up. You pick it up?!? Well you have to. Oh boy would I love to see that. SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel stop it! (to Elaine) I dont know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up? Maybe you should call the airline they might know where he is. No I tried. they dont know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first. No milk. Im telling you the guys a drunk hes probably on a bender. What is a bender anyhow? I dont know they drink and they bend things at the bar. I cant believe he hasnt called. Two hundred seats on a plane I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound! Sorry I cant watch the dog tonight. Why? Were going to the movies were gonna see Prognosis Negative. I cant I gotta get this Ellen out of my life. Youre breaking up? Oh ho ho ho yeah the sooner the better. I cant wait to do it. You know how theres some people you worry about whether youre going to hurt their feelings? With her Im looking forward to it. Id like to get it on video watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho yeah. Kramer I dont know how you lasted as long as you did. Woah you didnt like her? If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps. I cant believe someone hasnt killed her yet. How come you never said anything? Well you cant tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them. I tell you. You. Im talking about people. Are we still going to the movies tonight? No I cant I gotta watch Farfel you and George can go without me. Just me and George? Sure. But we need you. What do you need me for? Because... Yeah? Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice) Because I relate to George through you were like friends-in-law. Besides you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Cant you just put some newspapers down or something? No I cant trust him he gets insane. I wont enjoy myself. Thats right Farfel Im talking about you! Just me and George alone? Lets go people lets go! Its Prognosis Negative time wa ha ha ha!!! I cant go. Cant go Why not? Because I have to watch idiot Farfel. I thought Kramer was watching. Hes breaking up with his girlfriend tonight. Well so whats the problem you just put some newspaper down. No I dont want that smell in the house. You spritz a little Lysol on it. No its like BO and cologne they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk. So were not going? Nah. You two go. Oh. You still wanna go? Do do you? If you want. Its its up to you. Go ahead. Well its I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry uh you wanna see Ponce de Leon? Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you dont wanna go? I want to but I cant. Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if youre still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night. No. What about this-- Forget it. Go ahead youll have a good time. I know its not that. Its just we want you to go. Well thank you very much. Im telling you one more day stinkbreath! On my block a lot of ah people walk their dogs and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes theyre gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms one of thems making a poop the other ones carrying it for him who would you assume was in charge? So how long did you live there? About three years. Thats pretty long. Hmm. Its not that long really. Yeah. And then you came here. Yeah. So Ive been here about six years. Eighty-six eighty-seven eighty-eight eighty-nine ninety ninety-one... Yup. Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money you want money? Ill give you money how much?! I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why dont you do something with your life? Sit around here all day you contribute nothing to society. Youre just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldnt respect myself. I like herbal tea. Chamomiles good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure. Jerry likes Morning Thunder. Jerry drinks Morning Thunder? Yeah. Morning Thunder has caffeine in it Jerry doesnt drink caffeine. Jerry doesnt know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it. You dont tell him? No. And you should see him man he gets all hyper he doesnt even know why he loves it! He walks around going God I feel great! You dont tell him? No. That is so funny! I know! Wait have you ever seen him throw up?! Please! Please!! I take it all back everything! I take it all back every word! I love you! I love *you*! I cant live without you Ill Ill do anything! Thats right Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you thanks thanks very much. (Hangs up) Thats it Farfel! Partys over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy youre checking out! It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one. Oh one-on-ones a whole different game. Cant pass off. The only time it wasnt uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you. Going to the dog pound everybody! Going to the dog pound come on down. (To Elaine) What? Do you have to? What am I supposed to do? I dont want to do it. I like dogs. Im not sure this is a dog. You know the guy might have just lost your number. Im in the book and I have a machine. Jerry do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them they kill them. Really? How late are they open? What? What is it? I went back with Ellen. Ohhhhh thats great. Terrific. Yeah I really think you guys are good together. Yes she understands you and she is not demanding. Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her? Well I was just trying to be supportive you know. I knew you were upset. From now on when we pass each other in the hall I dont know you you dont know me. Oh Kramer we didnt mean it. What are you doing? Im getting my pot. Kramer we like her. Kramer? What did we say thats so bad? I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit. I said How come no ones killed her? Probably shouldnt have said anything Well. Well. everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah? Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice) Okay Farfel put your shoes on. Jerry cant you just give it one more day its not his fault. Its not my dog I dont know where this boozehound is. Alright I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies and I stay here and watch the dog tonight. I cant let you do that what about Prognosis Negative? Well see it Sunday. Tonights the night right? Prognosis Negative? Im not going Im gonna watch the dog. What does this mean? Well well go see something else tonight. Well see uh Ponce De Leon. What is with this dog I thought we were taking it to the pound. She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves Im gonna go to the bathroom. Uh Jerry how long will you be in there? I dont know regular human time? Uh why dont you wait then go in the movies? Why shouldnt I go here? Well you know I mean sometimes its good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom. And isnt it more fun using the urinal? Yeah. Oh yeah urinals are fun. Can I go?! Hey go. Whos stopping you? What are you doing me a favor? Like we care if you go to the bathroom. Hows it going? Good. Good. You? Things are good. Boy he takes such a long time. I know. You know what he does in there? He gargles. Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long? Yeah he does it like six times a day. How come we never hear him? Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit Just like this watch. Wait wait did you ever see him throw up?! We talked about that already. Oh. I have nothing to say to anybody. Im so uninteresting. I think Im out of conversation. So what are calling me six times a day? All I know about is sports. Thats it. No matter how depressed I get I could always read the sports section. I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire. Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out. It is? Oh yeah youre right. What else is playing? Nothing except Prognosis Negative. Boy I know she really wants to see that with me. Gimme the jacket furface this is not Seinfeld youre dealing with! When I get through with you youll be begging to go to the pound! Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No whos calling? Oh my god the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg. I mean I could understand if there was something else playing but its this or nothing. I dont know what to do. What is this saving movies thing? Somethings playing you go. I know I know. So what? Were gonna do nothing now this is crazy. It is kind of silly. Of course it is. I mean its just a movie for gods sake. Exactly. Its not like shes *in* the movie. Right. Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean if I could have seen it with her fine. But I cant control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples availabilities at movies. And shell still see it youre not stopping her from seeing it. How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You cant talk during a movie. You know this is stupid cmon lets just go. Good. Saving movies. Ridiculous! Two for Prognosis Negative. Im in big trouble. Oh youre dead. Bells Palsy. The entire side of my of of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldnt I couldnt I couldnt even feed myself I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel! You know its interesting because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday. Yes yes thats true but then I was taken to the Bells Palsy Center in in in in Rockford. Absolutely first first rate facility top notch physicians. Hey cmon cmon get off me! He wont hurt you hes just playing. Hey you keep that mutt away from me. Mutt? Ill wager his parents are more pure than yours. Kramer are you coming? Oh hi Ellen. Get in here. Listen its really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week but if you dont mind... Pre-prediction. Youll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out. Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life. We made plans. Why dont we just rent a movie? I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative. No it&Mac226;s its supposed to be really bad *really* bad. I mean its long theres no story its so unbelievably boring I heard. i... Jerry you promised me wed go. Well George told me the whole story line for line I mean I almost feel like Ive seen it already and walked out on it. Wait George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday he didnt mention it. You and George got together? Yeah I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about. Hello. Hi hi hi hi hi. Whats up? Well ah you were right. About what? Ellen. We uh broke up again. Too bad. I thought she was the one. Ill bring back the pot. Okay cmon its movie time. Hey what are you gonna see? Prognosis Negative. Hey thats supposed to be great. Its not. How do you know? I have an instinct for these things. I had a parakeet when I was a kid that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage and he would fly around and my mother had built one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes Hey look theres a whole nother room in there. Theres a guy in there looks just like me. But the parakeet will fall for this youll let him out of his cage he flies around the room BANG! With his little head he would just go click Ohh! And Id always think even if he thinks the mirror is another room why doesnt he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?]
21,3,5,[Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because its absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station? enters Ya got me I fell for it. Alright OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye. Whats the problem? This youre not goin to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it. Do you know how much that comes to? Thats a nickel a day for 20 years. Its going to be $50000 It doesnt work like that. If its a dime a day it could be $100000 Its not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ... That orange dress is burned in my memory Oh memory burn. I wonder what ever happened to her. How did they ever find you? Oh computers theyre cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous. Its George. Wait til he hears were going to the library You know I never got a library card. (to speaker) Coming down. Its all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter ooh I gotta go to the library. You want to go? Yeah The Dewey Decimal System what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal. Wheres George Shhh. Tryin to save a quarter. I kinda like those sticks. Id like to get them in my house. This womans completely ignoring me. Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didnt work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer. Eventually a little shot of penicillin Yes? Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail. Oh Tropic of Cancer Henry Miller Uh this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman. Bookman? The library investigators name is actually Bookman? Its true. Thats amazing. Thats like an ice cream man named Cone. Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think hes heard all the jokes. Can I speak with this Bookman? Just a second. Jerry Jerry What? I think I saw him. I think its him. Who? Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine Yeah. yeah I think thats Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School. Shhh. (whispers) Haymen Are you sure? Hes older completely covered in filth no whistle but I think its him. George got him fired. He squealed on him. Ooh tattle tale (yells) I didnt tattle Shh Shh What did this guy do? What happened? There was an incident. Id rather not discuss it. Oh come on You can tell me. Some other time. What tonight? Yknow I never figured you for a squealer. Oh he sang like a canary. Mr. Bookmans not here. Not here? Why was I told to come down here? Hell be out all afternoon on a case. Hes out on a case? He actually goes out on cases? Well what am I supposed to do now? Ill have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you. All right Thanks. Come on lets go Lets see if its Hayman? Hey uh Ill see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh whats a guy got to do around here to get a library card? Wheres Karen? She went to pick up lunch. Well she didnt ask me what I wanted. She must have forgot. How could she forget Ive been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years? I dont know anything. Ah you dont know anything. You see I dont know anything means theres something to know. If you really didnt know anything you would have said Youre crazy. Oh hi Mr. Lippman. Elaine Um uh I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that  um biography of Columbus I gave you? Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold. Ooh yeah Its freezing. ... Hurts your teeth. Im tellin ya somethin is goin on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing. So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal! What do you know. Youve never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See George youve worked in an office. Jerry thinks Im over reacting but you understand ... LUNCH! I dont understand lunch I dont know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesnt mean I turned him into a bum - does it? What did he do? He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying Costanza Hed say Cant stand ja. Cant stand ja ... He made me smell my own gym socks once. I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin down by his ... OK OK I never even had him for gym. I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse. Little baked beans Echh Come on tell me what happened. Well OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME! ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ... Cant stand ja ... Cant stand ja Yes Mr. Hayman Your underwear was stickn out of your shorts during gym class. Well I guess thats because I wear boxer shorts. Boxer shorts ha ha Well what brand? Im not really sure I... Well lets take a look. He gave me a wedgie. He got fired the next day. Why do they call it a wedgie? Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in.. They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare. Boys are sick. Well what do girls do ? We just tease some one til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life. I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life. Hey Babaloo you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library hes waiting for ya. Whats amazing to me about the library is its a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when youre done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. Thats what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And thats why everybody kinds of bullies the library. Ill bring it back on time ... Ill bring it back late. ... Oh what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel? Oh Im glad youre here so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea? You got any coffee? Coffee? Yeah. Coffee. No I dont drink coffee. Yeah you dont drink coffee? How about instant coffee? No I dont have-- You dont have any instant coffee? Well I dont normally-- Who doesnt have instant coffee? I dont. You buy a jar of Folgers Crystals you put it in the cupboard you forget about it. Then later on when you need it its there. It lasts forever. Its freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals. Really? Ill have to remember that. You took this book out in 1971. Yes and I returned it in 1971. Yeah 71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I dont judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library fella. Look Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically. Youre a comedian you make people laugh. I try. You think this is all a big joke dont you? No I dont. I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough it checked out. You think because youre a celebrity that somehow the law doesnt apply to you that youre above the law? Certainly not. Well let me tell you something funny boy. Yknow that little stamp the one that says New York Public Library? Well that may not mean anything to you but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure go ahead laugh if you want to. Ive seen your type before: Flashy making the scene flaunting convention. Yeah I know what youre thinking. Whats this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well let me give you a hint junior. Maybe we can live without libraries people like you and me. Maybe. Sure were too old to change the world but what about that kid sitting down opening a book right now in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesnt HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books youd better think again. This is about that kids right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on Seinfeld; maybe thats how yget your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya joy-boy: Party time is over. Ygot seven days Seinfeld. That is one week! Whats wrong? Its Bookman the library cop. So I I didnt do anything wrong. Im supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldnt have come here. Why dont ya leave? I cant. No way Im payin that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. Its a licorice gum. What do ya think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud opens phone book) Becker ... Becker ... Kevin went to a public school hes the 14 year old? We were gonna send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they dont learn ... enough ... I think. So Sherry what do you remember about that day at the library? I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress. Purple? Ya sure it wasnt orange? Positive. And I was chewin Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne? No Black Jack? Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book Tropic of Cancer. No Tropic of Capricorn Tropic of Capricorn? Rememba? What holds the world togetha ... As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse . Wait a second. Wait a second. Youre right. I had both of them. George heres the book. Dont let anybody see it. Dont let anything happen to it. Jerry its me George dont worry Ill return it Ok Ill see you after school. I.m late for Haymans hygiene. Where ya going? It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. Ive got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE! Read another poem. Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest. Wow that is great. You should be published. You know the library is kind of a cool place when its closed. Oh yeah. You dont have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO! HELLO! HELLO! HELLO! HELLO! Hello! Mr. Bookman. I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly discreet unattractive. We didnt know anything about her private life. We didnt want to know anything about her private life. She didnt have a private life. While youre thinking about that think about this: The library closes at five oclock no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that kewpie-doll? Lippman wants to see me in his office SEE ME! That cant be good Maybe youre getting a raise. Maybe Im getting a wedgie. What? Its George George is on his way up. Wait til I tell him about the book. (reading) sobs Are you OK? What? What? Its Marions poetry. I cant take it (leaves sobbing) Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT Im right here. Remember that Columbus book? Columbus Euro trash. Well its definetly him. Him? Him who? Him who? Hayman him. Hayman The gym teacher? You found him? Oh I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus That was double overtime. So I said Mr. Hayman Its me george Costanza JFK ...  He doesnt move. So I said uh Cant stand ya Cant stand ya He turns and smiles the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library  a grown man getting a wedgie. At least it wasnt atomic. It was. So Georgie Boy guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER How should I know? Because I gave it to you. Me? Yeah think. Dont you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room. The locker room! Heres the book. Dont let anybody see it. Dont let anything happen to it. Jerry its me George dont worry Ill return it tomorrow no problem. All right Ill see you after school. Im late for Haymans hygiene. Cant Stand Ya. Yes Mr. Hayman. Your underwear was stickn out of your shorts during gym class. Well I guess thats because I wear boxer shorts. Boxer shorts ha? Well what brand? Im not really sure I... Well lets take a look. (shouting) No No No! Anyway I hope theres no hard feelings. Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Yever have a man die in your arms? Yever kill somebody? What is your problem? Whats my problem? Punks like you thats my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld because if you do Ill be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle. (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying? Oh? So I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marions poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much. Oh beautiful did he like them? No ... he didnt! No ... he didnt! (to George) Was he out there? Na hes gone. I wonder what happened to him. I guess well never know. Cant stand ya (laughing) Cant stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground) Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English Geometry Social Studies and then suddenly youre like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know youre hangin from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin at ya Wheres your jock strap? Ya know and kids are throwin dodge balls at you. Youre tryin to survive ... Then its History Science Language. Theres something off in the entire flow of that day.]
22,3,6,[GEORGE JERRY AND ELAINE WHOS CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH AND KRAMER WHOS HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE HEAVY BOX.] One left...what a joke. You can have this one. No thats not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time. Hey I didnt get one either. Why do I always have the feeling that everybodys doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons? This is what people do. No they dont. Theyre out on some big picnic. Theyre cooking burgers. Theyre making out on blankets. Theyre not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the worlds cheapest air-conditioner. You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. Hed go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. Wed get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire. So we took a little ride. Whats the big deal? Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish. Big accomplishment. Fish. What do they do? What do you do? Its this way. What time is it? Five oclock. Always late. Always late. Youre not late. I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen. Who? My parents. Its their anniversary. Im taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think well hit traffic? Of course well hit traffic. Its rush hour. Isnt it going the other way? There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time. But its Saturday. You got the picnic and burger traffic. I always get myself in this position. Cant be on time. Gotta rush. Whats the matter? I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls? (CONTD) You want me to help you with that? No no I got it. (TO GEORGE RE:WOMAN) What do you think Georgie boy? Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me to see her? Im trying to live my life. Dont show me that. If you like her go talk to her. Yeah right. Ill just go up and say Hi how ya doing? Would you like a glass of white wine? JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman shed have her finger on the mace button. Shes like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off. Shes fat. Oh shes fat? What? JERRY Wheres the car? I thought it was here. You dont know where we parked? Oh this is great. Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one. I thought it was green. I remember seeing green. I didnt pay attention. This is just what I need. Im sure its right around here. It looks familiar. I remember the elevator. Theres elevators all over! It all looks the same. Its over there. I know where it is. Its black right? Dark blue. (MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot you write it down. How hard is that? There it is!...No no thats a Toyota. (CONTD) Hmmm...I thought it was... Didnt we come in over there? I thought it was over there. How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags? About two hours. (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) Youd better find this car. Its this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN PAIRING OFF: I really have to go to the bathroom. Why dont you go behind one of these cars? J (CONTD) Why? Nobodys around. Ill wait. You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. Thats what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. Alright. Jerry are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry? Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. Theres too much urinary freedom in this society. Im proud to hold it in. It builds character. (RE: CAR) There it is!...No thats not it. (CONTD) Hey watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. Thats the maximum. I read the book Im a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students cant locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? Its a mystery. ...Six wrong? Those school zones are a killer. (TO KRAMER RE:BOX) Will you let me help you with that? Im gonna put it down behind that car. Youre not worried somebodys gonna pee on it? (TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that. Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That Im supposed to remember. Where the car is thats insignificant. (LOOKING AT FISH) I think theyre laboring. Look at this place. Its huge... I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen when my parents get there they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades. Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week Im flying to Chicago to do a show Make sure you hang on to your jacket. Where the hell is this car Kramer? Its got to be here. Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty. Maybe its not on this level. What? There are four different levels. Maybe were on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up? It felt like a couple of levels. You should always carry a pad and pen. I cant carry a pen. Im afraid Ill puncture my scrotum. I have a pen. Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores I didnt see one bathroom. What is this like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go Oh my god we forgot the bathrooms. (O.C.) Dont you dare talk to me like that! You hear me? Look at that woman. I told you! I dont care! Youll have to wait. (TO WOMAN) Hey is that necessary? (TO GEORGE) Why dont you mind your own business? I think hitting a defenseless child is my business. (TO GEORGE) Youre ugly. ...What? Youre ugly. You are! You are! I shouldve hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I cant stand kids. Adults think its so wonderful how honest kids are. I dont need that kind of honesty. Ill take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day. (RE: CAR) I found it! Hes got it. Oh...no. All right thats it. From now on no more calling out they found it unless were sitting in it. Okay? Jerry look at my fish. His eyes look a little cloudy. Oh are they gonna be furious. Whos got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said youd been here before! It was easy the last time. My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car. No ones going to do that. Excuse me we cant seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if youre not in a hurry to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look. Five minutes. Were not wilding. (CONTD) Excuse me - I cant seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me... (CONTD) Oh thats funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! Theyre gasping for oxygen right now! Theyll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too? Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those? Right here at the mall. Excuse me... (CONTD) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They cant live in plastic. Thats not me talking thats science. Its amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and its like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in. You drank a whole bottle of water. I know. So why dont you just go? No I cant. Dont you get tired of following rules? You think Im too cautious? Why be uncomfortable if you dont have to? Its organic. Organic. Sos Buddy Hackett. Buddy Hackett? Hes a comedian. I know. All right. All right. (pointing) You can go over here. I can manage. (turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene) Itll take you ten seconds. Okay okay. Ill be right back. Okay lets go. Come with me. But... Come on. (STARTS TO LEAVE TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer Ive had this condition since I was eleven! Ive been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise I could die. Well youre still not allowed. Do you hear what Im saying to you?! Im telling you that if I dont go I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for? Thats up to you. So you dont care if I die. What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility. It was life and death. Uh huh. Oh Im lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know its against the law. I dont know. Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. Thats why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. (C0NTD) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh its Saturday. Theyre closed today. My luck. You can tell the police all about it. (CALLING OUT) Jerry! Jerry! Unbelievable Im never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee he never comes back. Its like a science fiction story. Maybe he went to one of the other levels. Ill go look for him. Oh now youre gonna go? ELAINE Ill be back in five minutes. If you go now I know whats gonna happen. Well find the car Jerry will show up and then well never find you. No no Ill be back. Oh whats the difference? Well all be dead eventually. Does that bother you? Yeah it bothers me. Doesnt it bother you? Not at all. See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me cause its people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because youre not bothered by it. How could it not bother you? I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment. Yeah yeah. Ive heard that. Meanwhile Im here with you in a parking garage what am I supposed to do? First of all you dont even know technically that I went. Thats for starters. I mean I couldve been pouring a bottle of water out there. You dont know. I know what you did. Oh really do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating. (CONTD) And you know when you think about it its really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. Thats all it is. Yeah Im sure. You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. Its a vicious cycle. And now hes gone. Im sure hes looking for the car. Five minutes thats all. I just want to find him. But why? Why cant you do it? No see thats not a reason you cant. You just dont want to. But why? Why dont you want to? But wouldnt you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out? (A NEW TACK) All right all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis the water bottle...I made it all up and now...Im going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth well Im jumping ahead here their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen. (CONTD) What I havent told you or anyone else for that matter is that my fathers been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years. The guys got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds. (NOT INTERESTED) Really. What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski? Whos Killer Kowalski? He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someones stomach and just squeeze it until they gave. Ive gotta go to the bathroom. So go. GEORGE Here? (SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry. Dont you believe me? Its their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. Youre aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life... Oh your folks have an anniversary today too? (TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison? (TO JERRY SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison? George! George! Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH) Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red Chinas great military leaders General Chang who by the way came up with the recipe for General Changs chicken. You know the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure I have it all the time. Very spicy. Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general but a helluva cook. (O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?! (O.C.) Jerry! Over here... (CONTD) Where have you been? I was arrested for urinating. (PROUDLY) Me too. You what? I have uromysitisis. Its very serious you know. Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he... No but hes not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR) (DESPERATE) Please we cant find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying. I can see not caring what happens to us were human. But what about the fish? The fish? Thats right go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. Im really impressed. (CONTD) Thats right you heard me. You got a problem with that? Elaine shut-up. Hey wheres Kramer? I dont know. (TO ELAINE) Wheres Kramer? I thought he was with you. See I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen... (CONTD) Look at the time thats it. Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side? We came in over there! We didnt come in over there! Wheres Kramer?

What kind a of sick society we are living in when nice is bad? Whats that smell? What are you wearing? What a little cologne. Manly. Monica wants me to wear it. So why didnt you say no? Im too nice.

Ive never been a guinea pig. Ive been a sheep a tody. You know I cant talk to you anymore. All right Im sorry. Go ahead youre taking the IQ test. Yeah and shes going to find Im a moron. You know people think Im smart but Im not smart. Who thinks youre smart? Im not going to break a hundred on this thing. What thing? You dont listen when people talk to you anymore! Oh Oh the IQ thing...yeah. Im sure I have a low IQ. Ive been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years. Whatd ya get? What did I get or what do I say I got? What do you say? I say fourteen o nine (1409). 1409 thats a good score. Psst Youre telling me. What did you really get? You are my friend. Of course. I tell you everything right? I hope so. Well this I take to the grave. Hes serving Mexican Italian Chinese. Hes all over the place. Thats why no ones going in. Why do you keep watching? I dont know Im obsessed with it. Its like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know hes not going to make it y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second. And then you flush. Well its a spider. You know sometimes people wont go in a place if they dont see anyone else in there. Do you have to do that? Jerry dont do that that is so annoying. Bazooka Joe. The buzzer. Its your house. My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom) Its George. Come on up. Casus belli. Whats that? Its Latin. I read it in some book. I dont know I just wanted to say it out loud. Come on Go in go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again] Have you gone in there? No Im afraid well start talking and Ill gonna wind up going partners with him. Hey. You know I could probably shoot him from here. Id be doing us both a favor. Im wearing some cologne all right? Sure fine. Casus belli. Casus belli. Whats that? Since when do you wear cologne? Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be let me live. Hey howd you do on that IQ test? I didnt take it yet. What IQ test? Whats casus belli. Oh its nothing... Is it about me? Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why cant you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why cant you live? Its just a Latin phrase George it does not mean anything. Now what is this test? This woman hes dating is making him take this IQ test for this course. Oh that sounds like fun. Yeah fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing. Youll do well youre smart. No see hes not smart. People think hes smart but hes not. Whad you get on your SATs? It varies. You know I dont even know my IQ. huh Mines 145. 145! Get out of here! You get out of here! You get out of here! Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing) Shst You should take the test for me. Huh. Boy thatd be something cheating on a IQ test. Haha (laughs) Hey remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then Georges legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.) Yeah yeah I really had some guts back then. Why dont we do it again? What? You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it she lives in the first floor. Are you serious? Why not? Where would I take the test? I dont know she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop. No thatd be too noisy. Take it to Dream Cafe you wont hear a peep. Hey what do you think? Hey I love a good caper. Yeah thats what is isnt it? A caper. Huh. Youll do it? What the hey. Yeaah beautiful... (They try to hit a high five but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry... Well ah Ive been looking forward to it. Oh ah how did you hear about us? Eh people people are talking. Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both. Ah non-smoking would be great. Very good.

What do want a Nobel Prize? You go in the living room. Ill take the test in here. But why? I wont be able to concentrate in front of you. Oh I think youre making too much of this. IQ tests dont mean anything. Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence. Well I certainly dont place any importance on it. Well I think youre wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again glancing in] And ah now if youll excuse me Id really like to get started please. Good luck. Dont need it. Nhuhuhu (laughs) Whats been going on out there? Ive been standing here 20 minutes. Im sorry Im sorry heres the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe. All right what time do you want me back here. Ah ah twenty to three. Ok. Thanks again.

Oh please... Oh welcome to the Dream Cafe. (runs to get a menu.) Our specials today... Oh no no no. Ill just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry) Tea and toast. Eat something! Babu... Um ok ah well Ill have the th-ri-rigatoni. Oh oh very good choice. Very good. Oh wow so you got the test. Youre cheating. I know. Hey. Hey. Oh boy. Woop... Jerry let me ask you something hi Elaine...  (pats her on the shoulder twice.) Hey. This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now she hasnt spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back. So? Well Im not giving it back. Why not? Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket you know theyre attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him? Oh gees... Ok Youre all right Yeah ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.) (eating some nachos) Anyway its been two years. I mean isnt there like statue of limitations on that? Statute. What? Statute of limitations. Its not a statue. No its statue. Fine its a sculpture of limitations. Wait a minute Just wait a minute...Elaine Elaine! Now youre smart is it statue or statute of limitations? Statute. Oh I really think youre wrong. Look Kramer I have to take this test ok I dont have a lot of time. What test? An IQ test. Hmm. Why you takin an IQ test? Its for George. George? Yeah can-look ... can I explain it to you later?

(opens the door for Elaine) Please Im very sorry. Tell your friends! Its all right she was cheating anyway. Youre a very kind man. Babu youre Pakistani right? Yes Pakistani yes. Babu may I say something? Of course youre very smart man I listen. I am not a restaurateur by any means but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example. But there are no Pakistani people here. Doesnt matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood. Yes you see everything dont you? Well you know; not everything. I do what I can. I close down today and when I open again itll be all Pakistani restaurant. Thank you thank you so much youre very special person very special. It was an accident. What did you go on a picnic? Babu Bhatt did it. Babu Bhatt? How Im going to explain this? Times up George. U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go. How did you do? Piece of cake; hu. What happened to the test? What? Oh I spilled some food on it. Food? What food? What are you talking about? Where did you get food? From my pocket. Your pocket? I eh I had a sandwich in my pocket. And coffee? Yeah had some coffee yeah.

Well maybe the test was gender bias you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles... Oh hello Professor. George I cannot believe... Please... No there has got be a mistake. You shouldve seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. But an 85? Listen there were too many distractions there.

Its green. Oh man its spinach! Ive been walking around like this all afternoon. Did you bump into anybody you knew? I had a job interview. Howd it go? Take a guess. Well Mr. Costanza we have nothing available at the present time but should anything open up well be in touch. Ok thanks. What do you need a job you got Audrey. Yeah right. Whats the matter? Oh nothing. What? You wont think Im a bad person? Too late for that. Cause believe me I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist maybe. Well her nose is a little big. Yeah shes got a big nose. I mean big would even be ok a little beyond big. Its a schnoz. Now Im aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection. A little. So who am I to be thinking about someones nose? I mean I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job nothing. But I have to say I think about the nose. I dont want to think about the nose. I dont ask to think about the nose but I think about it. I go to bed at night I tell myself Dont think about the nose forget the nose but I think about it. I look at her I see nose. Stop being so concerned with looks. Have you said anything to her about it? I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose I never could have gone out with her in the first place. Shed be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her I know that. And I know one other thing. Im not getting past that nose. Alright shut up here they come. (waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing. So my mothers going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so you know she gives it to me. Well two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now hes in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine all you have to do is go over to the apartment tell the landlord that youre his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison. Wont the landlord know Im not the daughter? No no hes never met her. Shes in California. Are you coming with me? Oh yeah yeah I have to. Im your fianc&eacute; Peter Von Nostrand. Why dont you just commit yourself already? What is so special about this jacket? He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women. Whats the smudge on your hand? Oh I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah Im going back there tonight you know Im not gonna pay another cover charge. What you didnt wash all day? Yeah I washed just not the hand. You wouldnt believe the women at this club. Ohh man. Its amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating. Well youre as pretty as any of them you just need a nose job. Kramer! What? What? How could you say something like that?! What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job. No no theres nothing wrong with her nose! Im so sorry Audrey. No its ok. What did you have to say that for? Well I was just trying to help out. Yeah? Well you can kiss that jacket goodbye Mr. Von Nozzin. You see what happens when you try to be nice? Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about? Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking? You look like youve got something on your mind. Oh yeah right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer huh? How about him? They way he just says stuff. He sure does. Yeah. Yeah hes quite a character. So what did you think? About the pizza? No about the nose job. Oh the nose job. I dont know what did you think? Well Ive thought about it but I dont know. Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care one way or the other but these doctors today really do amazing things you know if you were so inclined. And again Im not suggesting. I know theyre good. Peter Jennings had one. Really? Probably. They all do. In my high school half my graduating class had them. Of course Im from Long Island so... Uh huh. Its really nothing its like going to the dentist. I hate the dentist. Its a cleaning. So you really think I should do this? If it makes you happy I dont focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately we live in a very superficial society. I dont condone it but its a fact of life. Well maybe I should. What the hell. (barging in) Aw now you talked her into getting a nose job? Me? I didnt say anything. You encouraged her to get one. I didnt encourage. No encourage. Peter Jennings had one? Its possible. Well I think you should accept her for who she is. No George is right. I want to get one. I think its a mistake. Me too really. Unless youd really like to get one. Im going straight to hell no two ways about it. Well it might not be hell but youre gonna run into some bad dudes. (checking his watch) Hey lets get the check shes taking the bandages off at four oclock. We have time. Its exciting isnt it? Shes gonna have a whole new face. It is exciting. Of course not as exciting as miss crop circles but... Please please Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. Its like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And Im letting him win. Youre not letting him win. He wins till youre forty. Then what? He still wins but its not a blowout. She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her and I do it because Im so addicted to the sex Im helpless Ill do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day. (holding up a piece of paper) I dont want to see this woman anymore but I havent got the will power to throw out her number. Please help me. Help me. (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) Im proud of you. So Im never gonna see her again Im going cold turkey. Good for you. Ill tell you the sex... I mean I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited. Its like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring. Its not like that at all. How do you even know the jacket is there? Well I dont Im guessing. Okay look Audrey before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this you know? Now that youre gonna be a great beauty lets not forget how this all began. You know like if youd listened to your friend Elaine George? Yeah? Enough. Alright are we ready? Come on lets get this show on the road. Are you sure you want us here for this? Yes. Shouldnt a doctor do it? No he said I could do it. Okay here goes. Very exciting very exciting its like watching a birth. It looks good. Great job. You got butchered. Lets put him over here. (to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going? (with hand covering nose) To the doctor! Wait wait wait Ill go with you. How ya feeling? Too much salt in my diet. Can I get you anything? Nah Im good. You sure? Anything? Mmm no. Boy it really didnt come out too well did it? No it didnt. No it didnt. Its like all dented. Seems to be. Well Im sure theyll be able to fix it. You cant stop modern science. Cant stop it you cant stop it. Cant stop science. Cant be stopped no way no how science just marches-- Shut up George. Shut up? Yeah. Interesting. Come on Kramer seriously give me her number! I dont have it I threw it out. Youre lying! You got it I want that number! I told you I threw it out. Give it to me! You told me not to give it to you you made me promise. Well I changed my mind I want that number. You said no matter what you do or say Im not to give you the number. I was lying give it to me! No you told me not to! I want that number! Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what youve sunk to! Look at what youve become! Look in the mirror cause you need help Jerry. You need help because I cant stand by and do it anymore. Its turning my stomach! I cant stand around here watching you destroy yourself. Its eating me up inside! The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here... Yeah. You see this perinasal sinus cavity? Oh I got it. You see how its collapsing? Thats whats causing this huge dent. Yeah phew. So anyway George do you know what I was thinking about? What? Remember we talked about taking a trip together? We did? Yeah we talked about going to Hawaii? Hawaii? Anyway I think it would be great to get away after all this. (removing his glasses) You know Hawaii could be a little tricky right now theres a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year theres a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood and uh lava pretty dangerous. I never heard that. Oh yeah. My friend lived there. We could go to the Caribbean. You know I have to tell you something. You couldnt get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me he used to be a pilot so. Big investigation in the uh whats the word there uh offing. Its in the offing. But you know you shouldnt let that stop you from going. You could go. I dont mind. George I dont think this is working. Ever since you came back from the Army youve changed. I swear Nelson I dont even know who you are anymore. Im Nelson! Thats not the line Jerry. Alright alright Im sorry. (reading) Nothings changed Alma I just need more time. I swear Nelson sometimes at night when youre not around I just go crazy thinking about you. Well you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby bowling is fun. Yeah bowlings good if youre really gross and ugly. (to himself: Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again. Well Im getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles? Oh Brain what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who youre dealing with? Forget about it! I cant take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes. Oh so what? So you read from a little play. You cant put up with that for an hour to make me happy? Youre so selfish. Give me one hour then I will take over you will not have to think for the rest of the night. What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what thats like for me? Do you care? No you dont care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me. Oh go read a book. Enough chatting lets play. You know the only reason Im doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital. (filling a pipe) Yeah yeah ok now uh youre clear you got everything? Yeah. Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaines finger) Here. What do I need this for? Because were engaged. Were engaged? Um hm. Kramer this is too big. (lighting his pipe) Its my moms. Hello? Oh uh hi. Im Wanda Pepper Im Albert Peppers daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him. Oh hello Miss Pepper its a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand? Yes yes I am. Ive read your book Professor and I was quite intrigued by it. Uh yes. Well its uh very intriguing. Tell me is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter? My contention? Yes your contention. Yes thats my contention. I heard him contend that. Its too bad about your father. Oh it was a frame-up. A fine man he spoke often of you. Hes very proud of the work youre doing. Oh well were all proud of the work Im doing. She does fine work. Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closets this way. How kind of you. You know your father has a very extensive wardrobe. Whats the matter fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha! Nelson dont you see? You are a part of me and I I am a part of you. Its killing me. (Makes a move) Thats your move? Yeah. Well thats trouble my friend. Thats big trouble. Checkmate! (beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You havent seen the last of me. Ill be back. Youre nothing without me. Nothing! (before disappearing himself) Punk. Isabel uh I dont think this is working. Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe. He is a fine dresser and Im sure I dont have to tell you hes quite popular with the ladies. My father really? I had no idea. Yes theyre crazy about him. There was one in particular came around about two years ago looked a lot like you Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! Thats it Babs You dont say? I found it! The woman used to walk around here half naked sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out orthopedic hose up to her knees screaming down the hall Come back to bed Albert you big hairy ape and bring back that box of Danish! So I grabbed the guy by the collar. Yeah and I yelled out Kramer! Kramer youre killing him! So I assume the jig was up. Yeah pretty much. Hi. Hi! Hey. (to George) Hello. (smitten) Audrey? My god you look incredible! I cant believe it! (motioning to Kramer) Well it was his doctor. He was wonderful. So will I see you later tonight? Not sure. (rising and putting his arm around Audreys shoulder) Well Ill check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready? (holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didnt wash. Neither did I. Were off to the Reggae Lounge. (after they leave) Isnt she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. Shes breathtaking! Who would have though shes like-- (interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.]

Yeah this has got disaster written all over it. How did I ever let you talk me into this I must have been out of my mind. Now listen lets keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation we should have a signal that youre in trouble so the other one can get us out of it. How old are you? Thirty-six. Whats the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No no no I got a better one. Head patting. Whatever you want. You came all the way out from Manhattan for this? Yeah yeah I did. So what do you do? (Patting his head:  Im a comedian.

How come you keep tapping your head. Its a nervous tic. Im on L-Dopa. On the other hand you take a guy like George Washington Carver. The man devoted his whole life to the peanut. Imagine having so much passion for something. Ya know people tell me Im a funny guy. Ive often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan. Yeah me too. Now is that considered a nut because I know the cashew is a legume. Hows it going? Great how about you? I cant believe whats happening here. She hasnt taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office but that was it. How do you account for this? I dont know maybe a safe fell on her head. Well she obviously liked you all along. No I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me they always somehow let you know. With me they could torture me I wouldnt tell them. If anything Id try to make them think I dont like them then they think Oh look at this guy hes not even looking at me he must have something going for him. Anyway Im ready to go. Now? If not now when? Gimme a half-hour. Okay half-hour. Peanut brittle peanut butter peanut oil... (interrupting)  Can I talk to you for a second? Oh excuse me.

I I I cant. What did you say? Please its-- What? I... I... I long for you. I long for you? I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything. Its okay thats not bad. I dont like when a woman says Make love to me its intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me I wound up apologizing to her. Really? Thats a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I in the circus? What if I cant deliver? Oh come on. I cant perform under pressure. Thats why I never play anything for money I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel I have a very bad feeling about this. George youre thinking too much.

They guys in my house right now. What a mistake that party was I never should have gone. Yeah me either. Oh come on. What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office? Ive never had a job. You know the anxiety you feel on a date? Thats what I have every day now. My worst nightmares come true every day is a date. Thats one of Dantes nine stages of hell isnt it? Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly I dont know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation I dont go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people theyre all so loose and relaxed I think that used to be me. I want to go back there again. What are you gonna do? I have no choice Im quitting. The party Long Island? Kramer right? Hey what are you doing here? Im waiting for my ride. Wheres Jerry? He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that like a stupid question? Well Jerry he doesnt have anything. (Sensing Steves disappointment)  Well but I might have something. Alright Im gonna get this. This looks good. How much is that? Nine sixty. Nine sixty? Give it to me. Why? Dont worry I got it. What do you mean you got it? I got it. Since when are you treating me to medicine?

(more nervous)  What are you talking about? I know who you are I was watching you. (panicky)  What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police? Can I still buy this or is this evidence now? So Im chasing these doves down the street and shes screaming at the top of her lungs and then when the magician comes back from Europe two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions! (hysterical)  Ah they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something you know any women we could call? Not really. Maybe we should call one of those escort services.

Hello? Yeah the defrosters the one on the bottom just slide it all the way over. Youre welcome. Im in awe of his intellect when he talks it sounds like hes reading from one of his novels. Owen March I never heard of him. Well hes not a baseball player. Yeah thats true. Well it sounds like its going pretty good. Yeah. Well there is one little problem. Whats that? Hes sixty-six years old. Next please. Well go go. Can I help you? Name please? Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size and shes a small. Im kidding around of course. Okay lets see here. Sixty-six years old? Yeah well hes in perfect health. He works out hes vibrant. Youd really like him. Why do people always say that? I hate everyone why would I like him? What do you think would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman? Well Ill tell you she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant shed be spinning. Im sorry we have no mid-size available at the moment. I dont understand I made a reservation do you have my reservation? Yes we do unfortunately we ran out of cars. But the reservation keeps the car here. Thats why you have the reservation. I know why we have reservations. I dont think you do. If you did Id have a car. See you know how to take the reservation you just dont know how to *hold* the reservation and thats really the most important part of the reservation the holding. Anybody can just take them. Let me uh speak with my supervisor. Uh here we go. The supervisor. You know what shes saying over there? What? Hey Marge you see those two people over there? They think Im talking to you so you pretend like youre talking to me okay now you start talking. Oh you mean like this? So it looks like Im saying something but Im not really saying anything at all? Now you say something else and they wont yell at me cause they thought I was checking with you. Okay thats it. I think thats enough see you later. Im sorry my supervisor says theres nothing we can do. Yeah it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there. But we do have a compact if you would like that. Fine. Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance? Yeah you better give me the insurance because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car. Please fill this out. What do you think you think Im making a big mistake? Hey if you enjoy being with him thats whats important. I love being with him. I mean I like being with him. Its okay being with him. I just dont enjoy being with him. Well thats whats important. Im meeting him for lunch at Chadways around the corner do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone? How many times you been out with him? Seven? Face to face. Seven dates is a face-to-face break up? If it was six I could have let you go but seven Im afraid is over the limit. Unless of course there was no sex. Hmm... Hows the pasta over there? Whoa whoa!! What is going on out there? I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating I got an alarm that wont go off Im pressing one Im pressing two nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me! Hey you know they were supposed to do my scene today? Today?! You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries. Yeah. So I start to walk and I trip and the grocery bag goes flying and Woody Woody starts laughing. He was laughing?! Oh yeah he was drinking something it started to come out of his nose. So then what? I got a line in the movie! Get out! Thats great! You got a line in the Woody Allen movie? Pretty good huh? Youre in the movie? Is he in the scene? Oh yeah yeah its me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands huh? You mean *a* career. So was Mia Farrow there? Uh I didnt see him. Whats your line? Oh well uh okay Im there with uh Woody you know Im at this bar and uh Im sit-- you know its Woody Allen did I mention that? So Im sitting there with Woody and I say I turn to him and I go Boy these pretzels are making me thirsty. Is that how youre gonna say it? No no Im working on it. Do it like this. These pretzels are making me thirsty. No. These pretzels are making me thirsty. No no. See thats no good. See you dont know how to act. These pretzels are making me thirsty!! That was no good? I didnt say anything. Im gonna go break up with Owen. What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe hes been in the bar a really long time and hes really depressed because he has no job and no woman and hes parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! Im coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty! Oh my god. Call an ambulance. Boy he took it hard. We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch. (on the phone) Hello? Yes I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street apartment five-A. Tell then to hurry! Hurry! (To Elaine) Its an ambulance. (To the operator) I dont know but hes unconscious. These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy these pretzels are making me thirsty. Kramer. What happened here? I dont know I dont know what should we do? We called an ambulance does anyone know first aid? Shouldnt you do something with the extremities? What extremities? Whats an extremity? You raise the feet get blood to the head. You raise the head you get blood to the feet. Okay what about a cold compress? They always do that. I dont have a washcloth. Well use a paper towel. You cant put a paper towel on his head. What about a big sponge? How you gonna hold it on there? Use a belt. No no no no no thatll itll drip all over him. Should we walk him around? (at the same time) Yes yes. Yeah Ive seen them do that. No no thats for a drug overdose. Maybe thats what hes got. No no no no Kramer I just had lunch with him he didnt leave the table. Well he could have dropped acid when you werent looking. He is not a drug addict! Hey you know what? Maybe hes a diabetic he might just need a cookie or something. A cookie! Can you give him a cookie? Hows he gonna chew it? Well move his teeth it happened to my uncle the sugar revived him. Careful youre getting crumbs all over him. I got him chewing but I dont think hes gonna swallow. You know what lets put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it. Cookies dont liquefy. Yes they do you can liquefy a cookie. Alright Ill get a blender. What blender? I dont have a blender. You got a blender. I would know if I had a blender. Where is the ambulance?! (on phone) Hello yes I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago. I cant believe whats going on out here. This is an emergency whats taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second maybe thats them. (presses button) Hello? Paramedics. Come on up. Okay theyre here. He seems to be breathing. Ya know I gotta tell you hes a pretty good-looking guy. I know. Those eyebrows could use a trimming you ever mention that to him? Almost. Hey look at this cmon running wild there. Its not an easy thing to bring up. Yeah thats true. Aw you should see his bathrobe man its all silk. Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers. He does howd you know that? I could tell. What happened what took you so long?! We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldnt move the whole intersection is gridlocked Ive never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy whos running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort. Blue Escort? Thats my rent-a-car! Oh man. What happened to the car? Sorry you dont know whats going on out there! (looks at Owen) Whos he? This guy Im seeing. What happened? We dont know! Who put cookies in his mouth? Cookies? Youre not supposed to do that. So howd you hit the car? I was moving it across the street I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted. Its not even my car its a rental. What are you doing out there?! Youre holding up the production of the movie! We cant shoot and Woody hes really mad at you. Woody mentioned me? What did he say? He said Whos the moron in the blue jacket whos got the street all screwed up? Should I apologize to Woody? Alright Ill tell you what. Next time I talk to him maybe Ill bring it up. Ill feel him out. Now you didnt tell me you didnt know how to drive. You should have mentioned that. Well I know how to drive. Then howd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me. Can I get anybody anything? Moving cars from one side of the street to the other dont take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is whos putting your pants on? I put my pants on Sid. I dont believe you. If you can put your pants on you can move those cars. Well I dont want to get into a big dispute about the pants. Whos gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now hell be walking around with a limp because you cant park a few cars. Maybe I could call my father. Hey you seen the paper yet? Interestingly enough no inasmuch as it is my paper. Yeah. Theres an article in there about that writer. (reading) Owen March prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend. Uh huh thats the guy that was here. Youre the friend. (continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner. Oh lord. (finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over. Five seconds. Jerry I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were Owen its over. Can he communicate? Yeah well he nods. And I think he understands me he seems to enjoy it when I read to him. Alright shes free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi I called before uh my car got smashed. So listen what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now itll look like Im abandoning him because of his condition Ill be ostracized from the community. What community? Theres a community? Of course theres a community. All these years Im living in a community I had no idea. Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars. Hmm well I got the insurance and everything so... Yes now uh in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident. That is right somebody else was driving. Alright well sir youre only covered for when youre driving the car. Uh huh whats that? Youre not covered for other drivers. Other drivers? Um hm. Your whole business is based on other drivers. Its a rented car. Thats whos driving it other drivers. Doesnt my credit card cover me or something? Not that particular one. Well I got a hundred cards here pick a card take a card any card you want go ahead whichever one I dont care. Sir if you had read the rental agreement-- Did you see the size of that document? Its like the Declaration of Independence whos gonna read that? Mr. Seinfeld as it stands right now you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that. These pretzels are making me thirsty. Ahh its good isnt it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean huh? Dont they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean Yankee Bean I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owens mouth with a napkin) Owen I think we have to talk. I mean uh *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could but uh whatever. Um dont get me wrong I like coming here and uh feeding you and cleaning a little and paying your bills thats good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when Im with you wonderful! But at this point in my life Im not really sure that Im ready to make a commitment to one person. Im just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example I like running in the park bicycling roller skating tennis and skiing and um well Im gonna be brutally honest with you now Owen its a bitch to get here. Its two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway I mean this doesnt mean we cant be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty. Can you die from an odor? I mean like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks could you actually die from the odor? An overdose of odor? Good question. Do I smell? No no no no I was just down on the forty-second street subway today it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen. Ahh. Hes alright? Yeah hes almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex. Let me get that. No no no I got it. Please. No come on let me let me. I smashed your car it cost you over two thousand dollars (sarcastically) Yeah a cup of coffee should cover it. What are you doing here? I got fired from the movie. Get out of here why? Well you know they were gonna shoot it today and uh we rehearsed it twice then Woody yells Action! and I turn to him and I say These pretzels are making me thirsty and I took a swig of beer ya know and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered. Aww. Well one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out Im bleeding and he runs off. Anyway this woman she came up to me and she says Youre fired. Boy I really nailed that scene. Aw wait a--. Oh. Oh for crying out loud.]
28,3,12,[Oh yeah like you know what youre talking about. Like you do. Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France? What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table? I dont know. Its too early for a Christmas party isnt it? Why did France give that to us anyway? It was a gift. So countries just exchange gifts like that? If they like each other. Theres Elaine. See that guy hes talking with? Thats her new boyfriend. Really? They work here in the office? Yeah. Theyre having a little fling so dont say anything. Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like Ive got nothing better to talk about. You dont. Hes a recovering alcoholic. Really? Yeah.

Ba-boom (holding out a present) *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry) Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know whats good for you. Where did you find it? Under the sofa cushion. And you stopped by just to give it to me? Its your Christmas present. I though Id never find it. Well todays your lucky day. No. Todays *your* lucky day. It will be my first one. You want to work here? Huh? Yeah one of the readers left and theres a job opening. Dick this is Jerry and this is George. Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy? The guy?

And vodka. I got the cranberry juice. So... youre Jerry. So... Im Jerry. (he puts down the drink) (What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before? Well you know book reports. That kind of stuff. How do you read? I like Mike Lubika. Mike Lubika? Hes a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful... No no no. I mean authors. Lot of good ones. I dont even want to mention anyone because Im afraid Im going to leave somebody out. Name a couple. Who do I like? I like uh Art Vandelay. Art Vandelay? Hes an obscure writer. Betnik on the village. What has he written? Venetian Blinds. (picking up the drink) Ive got new for you. Im funnier than you are. Why dont get we together New Years day and watch some football. Wheres my drink? There. (turns to George) So how did it go? I think he was impressed. No no no this is just cranberry juice. Oh uh I think maybe Dick picked up yours. Dick? He cant drink. Hes an alcoholic. I told you to hold it. I didnt know you meant *hold* it I thought you meant hold it. One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon. Told you. I never feel comfortable in the womens department. I feel like Im just a *little* too close to trying on a dress. Do I really have to buy her something? Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this? What is that? Is that cashmere? Yeah. She would love cashmere. Who doesnt like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesnt like cashmere. Its too expensive. Look at this. Its 85 dollars marked down from 600. Wow. Excuse me Miss? Yes? How come this sweater is only 85 dollars? (showing the dot) Oh here. This is why. What? I dont see anything. See this red dot? Oh yeah. Oh its damaged. (grabbing the sweater) (grabbing the sweater back) Well its not really damaged. 85 dollars huh? Theres no exchanges on this. You think she would care about the red dot? Its hard to say. I dont even think shed notice it. Can you see it? Well I can see it. Yeah but you know where it is. Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it? Pretend you didnt know it was there. Can you see it? Its hard to pretend because I know where it is. Well just take an overview. Cant you just take an overview? You want me to take an overview? Please. I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. Thats my overview. Yeah so? Hes acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again. Oh boy can you smell it? No. I cant smell it. Well if you cant smell it then he hasnt been drinking. You dont always smell someone from a drink. Yes you do. What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink? Yes you would. Ill prove it. Would you do me a favor? Okay. Would you take a drink and let us smell you? You can smell me without the drink. I suspect that this guy Im seeing might be drinking but I cant smell it. Okay well what am I drinking? What do you got? I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. Its Hennigans. Its been here for two years. Ive been using it as a paint thinner. All right. I dont smell anything. Maybe were too close to the bottle. Yeah. (over the speaker) Its George. Come on up. That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you dont even smell. Thats right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I dont smell. Imagine you can walk around drunk all day. Thats Hennigans the no-smell no-tell scotch. Hello everybody. Hey. (snuggling really close to George) Im going to tell you what I think. I know you dont care what I think but Im going to tell you. I think that you are terrific. (uncomfortablly) Thank you. Hey whats that? Its an early Christmas present. Christmas present? For who? For you. *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here. Say you got a big job interview and youre a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and youll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because its odorless why it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n... Kramer. Yeah thatll do. (opening the present) Oh George this is beautiful. Is this cashmere? Of course its cashmere. Oh I love cashmere. Well who doesnt. My George this must have cost a fortune. Ahh money. Jerry how could you let him spend so much money? I tried to stop him. I couldnt. He just wants to make people happy. George this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me. Well good good. Take it off youre going to wear it out already. Its for special occasions this thing. Whats that red dot on your sweater? What? Just take it off. Im getting hot just looking at it. Uhh. This. Its like a red dot. What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here? (uncomfortable) Uh I dont know. Uh I dont know. What dont you know? I dont know. Well do you see it or dont you? Ahem. Say that again? Do you see it or dont you? Do I see it... or dont I? Thats the question. Now what did you ask me again. Youre still here. Youre a dynamo. I cant believe I get paid for this. Ill see you tomorrow. How you doing? Hello. You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you how did you do that? Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. Ive always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women chambermaids. Yeah chambermaids Im attracted to them too. Why is that? Its a woman in your room. So go ahead. So she starts vaccuming back and forth back and forth her hips swivelling her breasts uh... (trying to think of a word) Convulsing? Convulsing? I dont know Im trying to help you. Then I asked her if she wanted a drink. You dont drink. I know but I couldnt think of anything else to say to her. So you started drinking. So we started drinking and Ill tell you I dont know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me. So how was it? Well the sex was okay but I threw up from the Hennigans. Good thing the cleaning lady was there. Dick was fired. You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right and none of this would have happened. You knew he was an alcoholic. Whyd you put the drink down at all? What are you saying? Im not saying anything. Youre saying something. What could I be saying? Well youre not saying nothing you must be saying something. If I was saying something I would have said it. Well why dont you say it? I said it. What did you say? Nothing. Its exhausting being with you. Yeah? (over the speaker) Its George. Come on up. Hey let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay you just gave me the answer. No I didnt. Yes you did yes you did. I saw your expression. I didnt have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe. How much did he save? Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isnt buying a word of it) of me that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. Thats what you were seeing. I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. Shes pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me threatening to go to the boss with this thing I could lose my job I gotta do something to keep her quiet. Elaine is in the bathroom. Shes wise to whole red dot thing. Shes asking me all kinds of questions. Did you tell her anything? No. Do you swear? Im not swearing. I dont want to swear. Oh you told her didnt you. No. Hey George did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount? What? Did I what? You did didnt you. Elaine Im Im shocked. Im shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like shes not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas. Well Jerry told me that you did. You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything. I didnt tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you. Elaine you dont understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldnt distinguish one red dot from another. I couldnt afford anything. I have nothing. I havent worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look I have no clothes look at what Im wearing. Its just a little red dot. This is for you. Oh Georgie you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me. As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What with Clarence Thomas and everything. Okay okay can I open it now? Yes of course go ahead. My guess is youre going to like this very much. Oh! Is that cashmere? Of course its cashemere. A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie! Just a little something for Christmas. When I was a little girl in Panama a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him what do you call this most beautiful fabric? and he said they call it cashmere. I repeated the words cashmere cashmere. I asked if I could have it and he said No. Get away from me. Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh but I didnt want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere. I had a feeling you would like it. No dont try it on now try it on later. Wow look at this. It feels so beautiful. Take it off. Youre going to ruin it. (noticing the dot) Whats this? I was in the mens room the other day and they had the hand blower instead of the paper towels you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer but I feel when youre in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can. The only stench is comming from you. Oooooh. Oh wait a second I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I dont know what your problem is. Its not my fault youre back on the wagon. Its off the wagon. In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town? I dont know. On the wagon. Dont you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way? You cant drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy. They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap? What the hell do you know about wagons? I know enough not to get on them. Im going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct? Who said that? She did. Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon you know cause Ive worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time. Youre fired. Well you didnt have to say it like that. I want you out of here by the end of the day. What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there? Nah. Wait wait she wanted me to give you this. You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman. You never had sex in the office before? No. I once made out with someone but that was it. Alright so you made out with someone. Well thats not sex. Kissing is sex. Kissing is not sex. George? Jerry. Hey did Jerry leave that drink next to Dicks on purpose? No. George? Over here. What are you doing here? Im taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up. Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place? I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance. So George told me that you left the drink next to Dicks on purpose. Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night. Merry Christmas. Oh my god thats Dick. Its Cape Fear. Hide hide under the desk. Ow ow move over. Get off of me. Ive got no room. Is that cashmere? Of course its cashmere. (noticing the dot) Whats this? But in a way I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because theyre either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think hes okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. Hes finally off the wagon. You mean on the wagon. Dont get smart.]

What you think Im going to repeat the whole thing now? I know you told me you like her everything is going good. No everything is *not* going good. Im very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand... How do I get the hand? We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening. Shes playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets you and Elaine could go... Yeah that sounds like somethin... Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Yknow shell see me with my friends shell observe me as I really am as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way. Hey smell my arm... Smell it! With all due respect I dont think so... That smells good what is that? The *beach*! The *beach*? What did you go swimmin? Its 29 degrees out! I just joined the Polar Bear Club. You joined the *Polar Bears*?! What the Hell is a Polar Bear? Well its these people-- they go swimmin in the winter. Theyre terrific I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! Its invigorating.... Yeah... Sos shock therapy. [with glee] What is that a Pez dispenser?! Want one? Yeah I just bought it at the Flea Market. Hey what goes on there exactly? You dont know? No I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know... You think they have fleas there dont you? *No*... Yes you do Biff. Youve never been to a Flea Market and you think they have fleas there. All right I think they have fleas there. So what... I dont know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers? They have a piano backstage they warm up on. *No* we would have heard it. What do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out? I told her wed all go out afterwards okay? And dont applaud when she stops playing the first time. Its not over yet. [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! Thats directed at *me* isnt it?! Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps) Something I said? [no response] Its John... Mollika. Oh oh *John*... Oh hi John... Hi... Whatre you doing down here? Oh I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing. Jerrys in there? I heard you guys broke up. We did. Were just hanging out. REally. ... You really look great. Oh uh thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel? Oh Richie hes been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. Hes kind of messed up. On drugs. I dont know what to do for the guy. Have you thought about an intervention? Whats that? You get all his friends in a room They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. Its a very popular thing now. Hed never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. Hed listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry. Im sorry. George Im sorry! What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place? I dunno it was an impulse. What kind of a sick impulse does that?? How could I know she would start to laugh? Im sorry. Im sorry. I *am*! Can we just go in already? What are we gonna tell her? Ill tell her I was the one who laughed. No dont say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks then Im a *jerk*... [To Jerry] Oh remind me to talk to you about something later. What about? Hey hey! Were discussing something! I know but Im distracted now. What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her. When I was outside I ran into John Mollika. Really John Mollika they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. Hows he doing? Hes good. Uh can we cut to the chase? Cut to the chase? Yeah... Whatre you Joe Hollywood? A lot of people say it. I would lose that. [Accusingly] Whats *that*? Lose that? Thats not a Hollywood expression! [Realizing full well it isnt] ...Yes it is. Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and hes really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention. Really an intervention ... Yknow people we got a situation over here! Yeah but he wants you to be a part of it. Me? Why me? Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you. Yknow these things are *really* hard to load... All right OK Im goin in. Weve got to talk about this (to Elaine) All right. Hi hi hi You were wonderful. No.. Oh these are my friends Elaine and Jerry ... Noel You play a *Hell* of a piano. Yeah I was really moved *really* moved. Well didnt you hear that person laughing? I couldnt play. I was *humiliated... Well Im sure it wasnt *at* you. Well then what was she laughing at? Pez? Uh no No thank you. Did you see her? Me uh uh no ... Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant. Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg. Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg shes still the one who laughed. Ill never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits] Im sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being. If she wants to continue to have a fibre of her being shell be very careful (hitting each other) All right so are you ready so well go out and get something to eat. I dont feel like it tonight. Well be outside Yeah It was nice meeting you By the way How do you warm up your fingers before you play? I just crack my knuckles. Well have a good time I dont feel like it Ah come on I said I DONT FEEL LIKE IT! Um all right um uh Ill call ya. Ill call you and well talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu&eacute;. Every thing is fine ok uh fine .. [exits] You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place. What? How? A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldnt get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why dont you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Bensons head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it. So? What happened? What happened? The guy was like 67 years old it was freezing out he caught a cold got pneumonia and a month later he was dead. Shut up! All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same. Whar about Kramer? Hes the same! Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I dont have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture its very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel? (looks shocked) Oh sure the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson? Right well John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. Were having it here. Can I get in on that? What do you think? Its like a poker game? Is Elaine going? Yeah Well I knew him as well as she did. Yeah but John invited her. So what are you saying you dont want me to intervene? No intervene go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while were intervening. Its George Stop smelling your arm. You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach Hum a cologne that smells like the beach. I cant believe Im saying this Thats not a bad idea. Tell me about it! Why dont you call Steve DJiff he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact hes a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also. Well its over. Its definitely over. She broke up with you? No but I can tell shes going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about. What was on the list? Lets see How Im very good at going in reverse in my car why isnt Postum a more popular drink Yeah Postum is under-ratted Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said no maybe we could get together for lunch. You know what that means. Whats wrong with lunch? Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you dont move back to lunch. Its like being demoted. Ill never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it. I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble? I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand. Break up with her What? You break up with her. You reverse everything that way. A preemptive breakup. A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. Its absolutely brilliant. So I am have to going to break up with you. Youre breaking up with me? I ... am breaking up with ... you. Wow. Shocked? I really am. Never expected this did you? I thought everything was fine. Well live and learn. I dont understand. Youre breaking up with me. Didnt we have fun doing the crossword puzzles? Kind of. Im very confused. Well I didnt mean to hurt you kid. I thought... Now stop it ... What do you want I can make you happy. When youre playing the piano do you think about me? I dont know. This is what Im talking about. OK Ill think about you. All the time. All the time? ... OK All the time. I cant hear you. All the time. ALL THE TIME. See Its not so hard. Go ahead smell smell Yeah so? Do you recognize it? ... The beach. What are you talking about? Oh Im talking about the beach. What about it? You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah. That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard. Oh wait Did you here what I just said? Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? Thats why people take showers when the come home from the beach. Its an objectionable offensive odour. So you dont think its a good idea? The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there (very uninterested) Uh you have to work like that? Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me. Are there any ice cubes? In the freezer. I looked. There arent any ice cubes. Well I guess there arent any ice cubes. I cant drink this. Its warm! (walks away) Shouldnt we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes? Whats the plan? Do I have to talk? I dont feel like talking. Well if hes not going to talk Im not going to talk either. No we all have to talk. Whats the order? Well go in alphabetical order. First Roberta. Why am I first? Albano is your last name. Thats not my name any more. Im divorced. Ill go first. Hey. Hey. Is this the interference? Intervention. What are you doing here? Uh is it all right if I stay for the intervention? Hey this is for close friends only. Im a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Bensons head? Let him stay. Hey you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me big mouth. Somebodys going to make that crap? Kramer! Hey come on these are some of my polar bear buddies. They cant stay. Were having a party here? No were having an intervention An intervention? Whos intervening? Theres a friend of ours on drugs and were going to confront him. Sure we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say What you dont want to be a polar bear anymore? Its too cold for you? Its him. What should we do? Hide! Its NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom) Its George Yeah come on up. ... Its not him. If you dont go out with me its because Im a bar tender. Look I dont think this is appropriate right now. Is it because I have a tissue in my nose? Youre getting warm. We just came from Chadways(?) Whats going on. Were having the intervention for Richie. Oh right right the intervention. Should we leave? Well uh.. (happily) Elaine hi. Oh hi Noel Well youre looking well. Jerry let me tell you something A man without hand is not a man. I got so much hand Im coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer. Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldnt put that stuff on. (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius! You think so? I dont think so I know so Kramer come here I got to talk to you The male kangaroo doesnt have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy. (Chuckles) (laughs) That laugh. Thats the laugh. Thats it. Youre the one. No no. It was an accident. It really wasnt my fault. It was Jerry. You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?. I didnt know she would laugh. You lied to me George you lied to me. No I uh um wa wa What did I do? ... Where are you going? I ... am breaking up ... with you! You cant break up with me. Ive got hand. And youre going to need it. Hey Richie So whats going on? It was pretty ugly from the get go. hes not listening Hes hostile hes talking back. I cant do these puzzles. So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table Ah ah Pez dispenser. He picks it up - he stares at it - Its like hes hypnotized by it. Then hes telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father and his father was trying to load one of them Well theyre hard to load. Tell me something I dont know. So as the fathers trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobodys hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition. Poor kid. So as hes telling the story he starts crying. What did you do? What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser. Wow Two hours later he checks into Smithers clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. Hes doing great on the rehab. Hes hooked on Pez. Hes eating them like theres no tomorrow. Whats a three letter word for candy? I cant do those things.]
31,3,15,[Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life? Na. What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes. Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days? Yeah. Its George. Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that? I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers? I think Ill take out the garbage. Hey have you ever fasted? Well once I didnt have dinner until like 9:00 oclock that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me. Yeah right. Come on its just down the hall. Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks. Ill give you 50 cents. Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars. Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae Hey Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to the Cayman Islands this Friday. I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven? Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me. Nah I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline. Hi. Hi. How are you? Gina do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is? Of course the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top. How much do they cost? The junior? No no the full size. No no the junior. You didnt say junior. I havent had one of those since I was a little girl. Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing? Good enough. Boy shes sexy isnt she? Do you believe that guy? What guy? My neighbour: Oh that creepy guy? Yeah did he think I was flirting with her? He didnt seem too pleased. Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings. hey you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing. Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before. I havent seen him for months. What was the dream? I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off. I think Ive played there. Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me. Youre a little paranormal Hey George you know my friend goes to a psychic. Really? Uh uh you should go some time. Id love to go. Make an appointment. Psychics vacations. How about getting a job? I just got fired. Alright come on lets get out of here. I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast. I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits. Really? Oh yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits. Who is it? Who is it? Its Gina. Who? Martines girl friend. Martine? You next door neighbour. Oh Martin! Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills. What? Come on. In my pajamas? I better get my robe. We dont have enough time. Itll take two seconds. There is no time. We dont have two seconds? All right. Go ahead. Nah forget it. No go ahead. Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas. Will you just get it. Are you sure? Forget it. Come on. Nah Ill go get the robe. Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime. You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore. Really? Its over? I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach he was crazy with jealousy. Oh boy did he say anything about me? He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drakes Coffee Cake. He said that? He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it. Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly. I wasnt. You werent? No I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me? Of course. Tell me everything. Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN MARTIN. I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him. I would I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this. I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead. No I just wanted to see what time it was. Are you afraid of him? No. Then kiss me. Here? Yes right here. Is this the proper venue? You dont want to? No no I want to. I I very much want to. I I desire to. I I pine to. Then kiss me right in front of him. I cant. What if he wakes up? A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? What kind of a man are you? A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this ... you dont want to mess with it. Hey. Hey. Did you hear about Martin? Yeah I heard. I cant believe hes in a coma. Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do? Who told you about Martin? Newman! Hes good friends with him. Oh big mouth Newman. I should have guessed. Hes got all of my attachments you know. Hey let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out? What Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian? You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person? So whats going on between you and Gina? Well I went with her to the hospital last night. Uh uh. So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him. Uh uh you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right so what did you do? Nothing. Ah what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? I didnt know what the coma etiquette was. There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma man. It doesnt matter what you do around it. So youre saying his girl his car his clothes its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim. Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours its a land rush. So if the coma victim wakes up in a month hes thrilled he got out of the coma. He goes home theres nothing left? NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it. Martins spirit came to you as a warning. Why would he come to George? Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE. I knew it. I always felt different. You are. Some coffee cake? Drakes? Yes. Did you buy this for me? No why? Ha because I love Drakes Coffee Cake. Maybe I did. Take it away. She hasnt eaten in two days. Whos Pauline? Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline. Do you think about her? When I hear her name mentioned. Cut these with your left hand. There was a woman Audrey. She had a very big nose. I see an Audrey but with a small nose. Yes yes she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again? Not in this life. Should you be smoking? Does it bother you? Youre pregnant. Elaine. I smoked when I had Faisy. Ah oh. Ah oh? What? What Ah oh? I dont know about this trip George. You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What? Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that. Elaine shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be. Should I not go on this trip? George I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me. Now listen. I just dont know how a person with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. Elaine what are you doing? Its disgusting. I DONT BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave. Oh fine I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible. Get the hell out. A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus? Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando. If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash. Get out. Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash? I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles. You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse? No more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie. Who are these Stooges you speak of? Theyre a comedy team. Tell me about them. Everything. Well theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot. You will show me The Stooges? I will show you The Stooges. When? Well I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know. Come you walk me to a cab. Well uh I uh I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh with Martin and all well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building because you know he had a lot of friends here. Youre still afraid. You are not a man. Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet? Are you going to walk me to a cab or not? Yeah all right. All right. You should just eat fruit. I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent. ??? Hello Gina. Hello Jerry. Hello Newman. Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me. People smoke Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me. (jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move? Boy its a good thing we came. Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest. Hi I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray. Well call you. George I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage. How come? Looters. How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it? Shes really hungry. Hey. Kramer Well Newmans upstairs visiting Martin. Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket? Youre not going? No. Why not? The psychic said something terrible will happen. I dig. I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug shes going to kill me. He cant hear you you idiot. Why dont you just buy another one. Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one? I have a carpet sweeper you can use. I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything. It gets my rug clean. The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing. Well you should take a look at my rug then.

Why cant I just walk up to a woman on the street and say Hi. Im Theres just no men out there you know? I know. I mean the problem is that the good ones know theyre good. And they know theyre in such demand theyre just not interested in confining themselves to one person. I hate the good ones. Is Jerry one of the good ones? Thats a good question I think he thinks he is. Well the mediocre ones are available but theyre so insecure about not being one of the good ones that theyre always going Well Im not good enough for you what are you doing with me? and eventually I just go Youre right.

Oh my god. I cant believe it! Im a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it! So he shows up. Hes all out of breath. Hes disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine I was speechless. Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody. I said to him I really appreciate this but I just got my period. And so I asked him to come in he came in-- Hi! Sorry were a little late.

Let me tell it .. No you cant tell it .. You always tell it .. All right tell it. Ja ja ja - just tell it June 14 1987.... Mets Phillies. Were enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game. Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people you know they were waiting by the players parking lot. Now were coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us as he passes Newman turns and says  Nice game pretty boy.. Keith continued past us up the ramp. A second later something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward. What was it? He spit on us.... and I screamed out Im hit! Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me. Wow! What a story. Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as Ive heard this story a number of times. Newman Kramer if youll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newmans left thigh. That is one magic luggie. Well thats the way it happened. What happened to your head when you got hit? Well. uh well my head went back and to the left Again Back and to the left Back and to the left Back and to the left So what are you saying? I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward. So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right. But that is not what they would have you believe. Im leavin. Jerrys a nut. (Exits) Wait wait (Exits) The sad thing is we may never know the real truth. (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries? No. What happened to you? Now listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So when now when the phone rings youve got to answer Vandelay Industries. Im Vandelay Industries? Right. And what is that? Youre in latex Latex? And what do I do with latex? Ya manufacture it. Here in this little apartment? And what do I say about you? Youre considering hiring me for your latex salesman. Im going to hire you as my latex salesman? Right. I dont think so. Why would I do that? Because I asked you to. If you think Im looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff. Yeah. Its Keith. All right were coming down. KEITH HERNANDEZ:? Yeah come on Elaine lets go. Where are you goin? Hes giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive? Thats what Ive been trying to figure out the past five years. What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit) Well that was really fun thanks. Yeah it really was. Well ... UH do you want to catch a movie this weekend? Have you seen JFK? No I havent. Sure that would be great. I mean ... if you want to. Well how about this Friday? Yeah Fridays okay. Well good night [holds hand out and shakes hand] Goodnight.

It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. ... Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way. I told you! Wow it was McDowell. But why? Why McDowell? Well maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game. He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head. It was McDowell. Oh boy.

(opens partition) Scuse me driver we have to make a little stop first. I know. He knows? Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here? Maybe its a shortcut.

(closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didnt even know we were in a party. Oh Im telling you the jig is up. It was a bad jig to begin with we never should have started this jig. It was a good jig. It was a bad jig a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? Theyre gonna know youre not OBrien. There could be more than one OBrien on a plane who ordered a limo. First of all you dont look like any OBrien period. Well you should have been OBrien. I dont want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy? Yes you have to be Murphy. It makes no sense now me being Murphy. Youre Murphy! Im Seinfeld! Youre Murphy!! Look lets just jump out of the car. Were doing sixty miles an hour! So we jump and roll you wont get hurt. Who are you Mannix? Were slowing down. Are those the people? Alright put your hands up over your face pretend youre sleeping. (reaches out to Jerry) Mr. OBrien? No Im uh Dylan Murphy. Mr. OBrien had a long trip hes sleeping. (whispering) Oh well I dont want to disturb him. Were just rather excited to meet him face to face finally. Were faithful readers of his newsletter. Newsletter? And of course his great book The Game. Oh yes hes very proud of his work in the big game. So youve never uh met him before? No. Never seen a picture of him? Never. Not even on the book jacket? There was no picture on the book jacket. (nudging George) Hey OBrien wake up cmon we got company. Wake up. Hello. Im OBrien. Hey! Hey! What you took a cab? Yeah? So? How much do you make? Im not telling you. Cmon. No!

You think someones been tipped off? So um youve read The Big Game have you? (fawning) Yes Ive read it and Ive memorized it. Tell me your impressions I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of The Big Game. Well this is sort of embarrassing but its changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. Youre a brilliant brilliant man. Well its just a game. Remember that kids. Just a game. Hes so humble. Dont forget what you wrote in the epilogue the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game. Well I was exaggerating a bit just for effect. He tends to exaggerate. Okay I mean its serious but-- We are really looking forward to your speech tonight. Uh my speech? Yes your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over? Well you might as well look it over. So whats going on how did all this happen? Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said were all going to the Knicks-Bulls game. Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up. He did. Well then why would they take a limo from the airport? I dont know. Thats pretty strange. Did he say anything else? Yeah. He said um he said its really important that we call them OBrien and Murphy. OBrien. Why would he want to be called OBrien? ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities. Youre not going to open with that are you? What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust? I said so many things. Theyre shooting! Theyre shooting! (pulling out a gun) Alright get down! Thats really very nice of you Eva. Thank you. But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything. Nothing to worry about it was just a flat tire. But rest assured were prepared to handle anything that might come up. Nice looking Lugar. Im standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald OBrien the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. OBrien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades but quite frankly Bill and Jean I dont think theyre any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount Im Jodi Baskerville back to you in the studio. Somethings very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called OBrien and Murphy? OBrien. OBrien why OBrien? Elaine? Dan! Oh hi Dan how are you? Good. Um oh this is um Kramer. Oh Kramer? Whats going on? Oh were heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking hes in from Chicago. You should come. Oh cant Im going to the Knicks-Bulls game. Oh well thats where the rally is. The Paramount right next door. Oh well maybe well run into you. Yeah yeah ok. Its really gonna be something this is the first time hes ever appeared in public no one even knows what he looks like. Who? The head of the Aryan Union; OBrien. Whats taking him so long out there? Didja see the way she was looking at me? Shes a Nazi George. A Nazi! I know I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though. Well we gotta make a plan before they come back what are we gonna do? I dont know. Lets just make a run for it. I cant run I have a bad hamstring. Howd that happen? I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I cant sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it. I know why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that. For a mental patient. Wait a minute the phone well call the police. 9... 1... 1. She said shed do anything. Hello police? Uh yeah listen were in the back of a limo in Queens-- --Astroturf? You know whos responsible for that dont you?! The Jews! Ah the Jews hate grass. They always have they always will. Well be ready in a minute. Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy were kind of in the middle of something. With all due respect Mr. OBrien were just about to leave. Tim whos the head of the Aryan Union you or me? You are. And whos responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again? You are. Good. I think you forgot something. Im sorry. Good. Now get out. Okay what are we gonna do? I dont know. Alright hows this? We wait till we get to your street corner we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They cant shoot us in the city. Nah. No ones ever been shot in the city. Im telling you somethings going on. I can feel it sense it. Im sure he was just joking around. Oh no no no this is no joke. OBriens coming in from Chicago Jerrys in a limo says hes OBrien? Thats not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes! What is it? Dont you see? Theres always been something very strange about Jerry always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry OBrien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union! Jerrys a nazi?! I cant believe I didnt see it. Listen you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry hes not a nazi. You dont think so. No hes just neat. You know its funny. You dont look like an OBrien. Me?? And you really dont look like a Murphy. I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy. Hes extremely Murphy. Hes Murphy to a fault. Where are you from? Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldnt get a bowl anywhere. Bad. Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills and the peat ah the peat. Sounds more like Scottish. We were right on the border. Maybe hes with the company. What? The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within. What about his comedy act? Thats the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry hes too normal to be a comedian. These comedians theyre sick neurotic people. What about George? What about him hes part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine Im telling you theyre with the organization. Theyre all part of it. Hes in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy that whole crowd. George and Jerry they probably know who killed Kennedy! Ill bet they were even in on it. Alright what are we gonna do? Im not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) Im not gonna. Kramer youre hurting me! Those are my friends I was telling you about. Were gonna talk to them pull over. Get off of me!! OBrien. Lets get him!! What do I do?! What do I do?! Get in the car! Get in the car! (pointing to Jerry) OBrien. Long time no see. Hows tricks Murphy? Why did you call him OBrien and him Murphy? No he was talking to me hes cross-eyed. It could be very confusing. Yeah? Eva? Its for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) Its OBrien. OBrien? Well thats weird. (gun drawn) Who are you? A limousine has just pulled up its being surrounded by a huge group of protestors this has the makings of a very ugly scene. They are banging on the car trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd I would imagine Mr. OBrien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance. Get out!! Look its Dan! Hi Dan! Elaine? Hey! I am not OBrien! I am not OBrien! Im not OBrien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!]
36,3,20,[You know its bad enough you have a car phone you have to use the speaker? Its safer! Plus its more annoying to the other person. Oh look at this guy. Whats goin on? Oh theres a guy trying to get in front of me he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in get in. Did you get a thank you wave? No nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Wheres my thank you wave? Give me that wave! Jerry are you free on Friday? Yeah Im free why? Ah God I bumped into Robin Sandusky today she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband. Oh my God! You wont believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car and sped off right on my block! You gotta follow that car! What? You cant let him get away with that! Elaine the guy could be dangerous. What are you yellow? Im not yella. (In a cowboy voice) Jerry if you dont follow him youre yella. Wait he stopped hes parking. What? What? I cant hear you. Jerry? Uh excuse me uh I was uh driving behind you uh a few blocks back and I I couldnt help uh maybe you didnt realize uh I witnessed that uh um youre tires a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension not to mention your rack and pinion steering. So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her. Boy! What a story! Im speechless. Speechless. I have no speech. You know I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left she reached out and touched my arm. He he he. (Simulating her feminine laugh) I love when they touch your arm. I cant get enough of that. Why is that? Lets not even analyze it. So you didnt turn her in? I wanted to but I couldnt go through with it. Gonna see her again? Friday night. Yep. Its me! Come on up. By the way Elaine does not need to know about anything. Hey hey hey! I dig. Oh you dig? Yes! I see enormous potential here. Why? Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. Thats why Ive never been in a long term relationship. Ive never had a good meeting story. I wonder if Im nuts for pursuing this woman at all. I dont think so. Look she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger then she sped off like a criminal! On the other hand does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and youre forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?! What am I drinking milk? Hey! Hi. Sweater. Thank you. So? What happened? With that? With the car! What car? The hit and run! Oh right right right right right right right the hit and run. Well. Actually the guy went into Queens. Queens?! You followed him over the bridge? Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand) Oh well I didnt know you went into Queens Jerry. Yeah Queens. So? Then what? So he gets out of the car I say Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car! So he says to me What are ya gonna do about it? So I said to him Whatevers necessary. I am speechless. I am without speech. Tell her about the shoving. What? What shoving?! Oh it was nothing. No! Tell her. Well he kinda lost his temper and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches) You know karate?? I know a little. Well this is so amazing to me! Jerry what did do? He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually. Hey! (Group does likewise) Did you tell Kramer? Ah nah! (Waving his hand and walking away) What? What? What? Tell me. Jerry saw this guy crash into a car and he followed him. Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people you know theyre mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry) They should be sent to Australia. Australia? Yeah yeah thats where England used to send their convicts. But not anymore. No. Hey Kramer Kramer! Yeah? What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead) I dont know! You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight and uh suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table. Well that is that is strange. Yep. (Mumbles off) Alright oh Jerry were still on for Friday night right? Oh Friday I cant Im sorry I have a date. But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed) We just met. Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines. But I I cant go alone! Ask George to go with you. George come on! Ill pay for you. Youll pay? Im there. Why do you even need anybody? Because I hate being at a table alone with a married couple. Talking about their married friends and their married furniture. Theyre always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know I have a very exciting life. Its very exciting. (As shes closing the door to leave) You went out with a bullfighter? Yes well an ex-bullfighter now. Wow. What was his name? His name? Name um his name was uh uh Eduardo Carochio. Pass the salt please. Where did you meet him? Um actually I met him in Switzerland and he was fighting uh is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they dont really fight the bull they avoid fighting the bull. Bread. I just love meeting new people. You know thats how you really do learn about life. God bless you. Thank you. I wasnt going to say anything but then I could see that he wasnt going to open his mouth. (Chuckles) You know whos a good actor? Anthony Quinn. Oh Anthony Quinn fine actor. But from what I understand not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note. Did you ever see Zorba the Greek? Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car. Come here. (moves in for a kiss) Really I was I was only kidding around. He was only joking Michael. You think youre so damn special because you say God bless you? No no I dont think Im special. My mother always said Im not special. He was only joking Michael! Sorry. All right! Take his side! I am not taking his side. Well whos side are you taking?! Well Im not taking your side! Kirk Douglas. Now theres another very bad driver. But hes such an unbelievable guy that when he hits someone he doesnt even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license registration and apologize. I said God bless you. Was that so wrong? The question is did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his God bless you? Because as the husband he has the right to first refusal. Its me. Come on up. Yes yes I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option that God bless you is up for grabs. No argument. Unless shes one of these multiple sneezers and hes holding his God bless you in abeyance until she completes the series. Well I dont think she is a multiple sneezer because she sneezed again later and it was also a single. What if shes having an off night? Hi! Hi. Well! If it isnt mister gesuntheit! Oh ya like theres something wrong with saying God bless you. I was raised to say God bless you. Ah shut up. What does it mean anyway? God bless you. Its a stupid stuperstition. A stupid what? Whatever. You know if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze you shouldnt say God bless you you should say Youre soo good lookin. Yeah yeah thats better than God bless you. Anyway she left a message on my machine she wants you to call her. Who? Robin! Why?! Well I assumed she called to apologize thats why she called me. Entertainment Tonights on. Wheres the remote phone? Bedroom. Hey grab Jerrys sweater for me would you? Whats it like out? Chilly out. Can I take a sweater? Yeah you can take a sweater if you want to. Scarf? Nah hey shut this off shut it off. Whats the matter? Whats going on? What happened?! What? I think I hit my head again! What is wrong?! Hey hey wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer the last time you hit your head was Mary Hart on TV? Yeah. That is it! What? That is it! Mary Harts voice dont you see? Theres something about Mary Harts voice thats giving you seizures. Just like just like just like that woman in Albany! Mary Hart! God. What? Well she apologized and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon. Get together? Maybe she just wants to talk to me? Married women dont get together. They have affairs. Oh my God an affair. Thats so adult. Its like with stockings and martinis and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldnt cost me any money. Are you actually considering this? I cant have an affair with a married woman thats despicable! Yeah its like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note. Yeah. Hey you know who owns that car? What car? The one that was hit a couple of nights ago. Yeah who? That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail she wears those blue sweatpants. The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah I think Ive seen her. Well Ive got to get going. Im meeting a guy with grey sweatpants. Wait wait wait how do you know its not John Tesh? The blond with the blue sweatpants! Well who is she? Ive had a crush on this woman for year! Ive always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards. Oh right right! The blue sweatpants! Gees its too bad you cant say anything because of Angela. Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I cant sit by and allow this to go on. Its a moral issue is what it is! You cant compromise your principles! How am I going to live with myself?! Cant live! Im not religious but I certainly know where to draw the line! This country needs more people like you! Dont sell yourself short saying God bless you to every Tom Dick and Harry in great personal risk. I believe strongly in that as you know. There should be more people like us. Thats why the worlds in the shape its in. Youre telling me. Anyway I just wanted you to know that Im going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that. Well God bless you. Thank you very much. Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done? Oh no whats wrong? Whats wrong? Ill tell you whats wrong. I just committed adultery! You didnt commit adultery I did. Oh yeah. If I didnt do it with you I would have done it with someone else. Well I wouldnt want you to do that. You know theres a lot of losers out there. Maybe even someone who didnt say God bless you. Well thats a given. In three years with Michael not one God bless you. Must be hell living in that house. Hi its Michael. Hi Michael! Is Robin there? Robin? No why? Uh she said she was going to be with you. No I havent spoken to her all day-uh yeah right um as a matter of fact um she was here and she uh left a note but I wasnt here but I have the note uh right here. If shes not with you then where is she? Well I I dont know. Is she with your bald friend from the other night?! No no come on Michael! Hes finished! Im going to sew his ass to his face! Im going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! Im going to break his joints and reattach them! Youre soo good lookin. Now you listen to me suck face! You tell anybody anything and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue! Let me rephra- Ill bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage and Ill have a party on your head! Hi Elaine this is Angela. Ill pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth! Well I think I get the gist of it. So you dont say anything to anybody about me hitting that car! What car? Good. Im glad we understand each other. Its not complicated. Very nice meeting you! Come on up. Well well well Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy in Queens! Now lets just see if Ive got this scenario right. Alright Elaine. No no no no no. Because Im picturing French Connection kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city! It was just a couple of blocks. Oh no no come on. Dont be so modest! Hey. Oh did you check you machine? No why whats happening? Michael called me today and he asked me where Robin was. Yeah okay. And I said I hadnt seen her. What?! No no George! You dont understand! She didnt tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on and I said that she left a note. Um but he didnt really buy that. And then and then he did mention your name. He mentioned my name?! What did he say?! He said he was going to sew your ass to your face. What? Why couldnt you think of something?! Well I dont know he caught me off guard! You lie! How hard is it to lie?! Its not that hard. Well who told you to sleep with her George?! Its not my fault! I wasnt going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador! Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldnt have said God bless you! Oh dont- Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador? She told this couple she had an affair with a matador. A matador! Well well well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell what was the young mans name? Uh Eduardo uh Carochio. Eduardo Carochio! Thats good. Thats very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza! Anyway this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage. Well I already got an estimate. Its $875. $875? Thats right. Uh well Ill tell you what. Um Ill give you a check and then this person can pay me back. Um who do I make it out to? Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E. So what are you doing this weekend? You have got some nerve! You smash up my car you dont admit it and now you want to ask me out on a date? I didnt do it! Yeah righ- You are soo good lookin. Thank you. Jerry lets go! You ready? You sure you want to do this? Im going to be on the road for three weeks! Excuse me Ive got a maniac stalking me Im not staying in the city. Alright! Come on lets get out of here. How could you? What?! Man! I never thought you were capable of this! What did I do? I just talked to Becky Gelke outside she told me how you hit and ran. I- I dont even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and youre nothing but a felon. Youre an embarrassment to the building. I didnt do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else! Now youre not going to lie to me are you? No never. Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because Ive got a date with her. You got a date with Becky Gelke?! Yeah going out with her Saturday night. Jerry can we get out of here?! As a matter of fact if it wasnt for you I wouldnt have even had an excuse to talk to her. Well Im happy to help in any way that I can.]
37,3,21,[(laughing) Kramer would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving. You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it! No thats the last thing in the world I want you to do. Well why dont you take your clothes off? I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that. (debonair smile) Well itd be our little secret. Jerrys apartment] (bursting out of the bathroom fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open! I like the button fly.

Want to come up to her lot check out her paintings? I dont get art. Theres nothing to get. Well it always has to be explained to me and then I have to have someone explain the explanation. She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact shes painting Kramer right now. What for? She sees something in him. So do I but I wouldnt hang it on a wall. Ninas studio again--same scene] Are you getting the eyes? Cause theyre brown. (beat) Or really theyre dark brown like rich Columbian coffee. Tell me about Elaine. She and Jerry were a big thing like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd. But theyre still friends. Oh yeah theyre like this (holds up two fingers together). Dont you think thats strange? Why whats the difference? Well are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends? Well you know... I uh... have many relationships. the door outside Ninas studio] You know Im a little nervous. Why? Well you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like Im getting fixed up for a friendship. I dont know how long this is gonna last. Really? I thought you liked her. I do... shes got like a jealousy thing. She doesnt like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door) You know its a miracle youre not married. (beat) Hey Im not obligated to buy anything am I? Hi Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George. How nice to meet you Ive heard a lot about you.

(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure sure Im interested. George you gonna buy a painting? (gritting teeth) Yeah sure. Are you an art-lover? I am an art-adorer! I adore art. Great! Well take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.) May I? (pantomimes making a big X across the painting) (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope) Whats this? My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owners box first row behind the dugout. (sincerely disappointed) Oh Saturday... Im working Im going out of town. Oh well. Im not gonna go without you. Do you guys want em? (immediately) Yeah. Theyre right behind the dugout George first row! Behind the dugout are you kidding? How did you get them? Oh my fathers the Yankees accountant... its the owners box. All my life Ive dreamed of sitting front row behind the dugout! (gesturing towards a small ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one? Saturday the game. George Kramer and Elaine are being lead to their seats] Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) Hes not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) Were not in the first row? No no these are your seats. She said first row! Right behind the dugout! Well its the second row. Its just as good. I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout! Would you shut up? These are great! You cant get any better than this. Oh theres better (pointing at the row in front of them) right there thats better. Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day! I couldve been at my boss sons bris right now. (amused) Youre supposed to do that? (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision? Id rather go to a hanging. Anyway I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs) (screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT George? Yeah? Hi. Im Leonard West Ninas father. Hi! Mr. West this is my friend Elaine-- Hi! (screaming again) HEY 230 AINT GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN BABE! --and this is Kramer. Oh hey. So how are the seats? Okay. Great great. Yeah. George I heard you bought one of Ninas paintings. Yeah its being framed right now. I dont even know what it costs. (beat) Not uh too expensive is it? Well if you have a lot of money. (leaving) Well enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap. (thinking hes joking) Yeah. I better! No no no. Seriously. Youre in the owners box and I dont think its a good idea. Youre not serious. Yes yes yes I am! Well did he say that? No no but he gave me the seats. I dont think hed like it if you wore an Orioles cap. Well maybe you should ask him! I dont have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not? No! I dont have to take it off why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!! Just take the cap off. George we are at a baseball game! This is America! Look. Either you take the cap off or youll have to leave. Well I dont care Im not taking it off. Just take the cap off! No! Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here! (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you? (getting up) Ill go get your hat George. (sarcastically to George) Stay! Okay well go! ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing! Is he okay? Well yeah hes fine! We took him to the emergency room and you know the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day! This is the most amazing story Ive ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane! I know! Can you imagine that? How you feeling? Oh yeah yeah Im fine Im fine.

(beat) Ill just hold down the uh fort! Ninas studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Ninas Kramer.] Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.] She was a guest of my fathers. She shouldve taken the cap off. Its preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that? Armstrongs admiring painting again.] Jerry and Nina again.] Look Im really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other. Oh well you wouldnt want that because you always have to remain friends! Well I like to remain friends with people I was friends with! Hey -- why dont you just go then! And -- oh give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500! Armstrongs] Jerrys apartment.] Five-hundred dollars?! What? Thats what she told me! Im not paying $500 for this! Its a piece of junk! Thats what it costs! Why did you even take it? You broke up with her! I wasnt thinking! I dont know. You werent thinking. Well she framed it and everything. Well Im not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way Im buying this! (beat) I mean look at it! What is it? Its a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldnt paint this? Do you want me to paint you something? Id love to paint you some- thing! Im not paying for this. If you were going out with her itd be a different story. (entering handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door. Hey Kramer. Hi Mike. (looking at the paper) Wow a letter from Nina! (notices the painting) Whoa man! That is the ugliest thing Ive ever seen! (reading note) Oh my god! What? This is amazing you cant believe this! Whats it say? Listen to this: I dont know what you expect to find out there Jerry you know what you want better than me. But theres one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything Ive ever wanted in my life wanting to smash your face with my fists because you wont make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that Im will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity. WOW! (emotionally) Shes deep.

You want me that fight for me becau- You know Jerry she sounds like a poet! No ones ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her! (pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah!

ALL RIGHT all right! Ill call her. Jerrys apartment another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her coat. The TV is on a horse race.] SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya!

George Elaine and Jerry are watching TV.Jerry with the remote is furiously flipping through channels.] (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when youre the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker) (tugging at the clicker) Im a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking. Youre all over the dial! You dont know what you want! Ive never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that. Let go! No come on! I want it Jerry! Let go Elaine! Well at least let George do it! Oh George cant click! (George joins in the fight) (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads. Wait wait a second! Go back go back to that. (they watch it a little longer) Its Chapter 2 its Neil Simon.

I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief a bunko-artist! Maybe I wont send her that check.

Okay please! Please tell me! Alright Ill tell you but your begging needs a lot of work. Okay okay what is it? Come on. I loaned the car to George. Ah George alright. Well what for? George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester okay?! Alright. Huh? Huh. I mean what do they want to go there for? Will you stop it already?! You know why didnt they ask me to go? I dont know! How am I supposed to know?! What they dont like me? *I* dont like you! If they like me why dont they ask me to go? Oh yeah. I really think it looks good. Ten bucks how can you go wrong? All bald people look good in hats. You should have lived in the twenties and thirties you know men wore hats all the time then. What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew. Well you can wear a hat all the time now. Whos stopping you? No I cant. What if I meet a woman? Id always be worried about that first moment where Id take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face. Are you sure you like these sunglasses? Well Im very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know Im somebody you dont want to have on your bad side. Why not? Because Im like ice buddy. When I dont like you youve got problems.

Please dont make me beg. No no no I want you to beg me. And I dont want you to say it I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on. Kramer please tell me what the guy said. No no no thats no good. No I really dont think thats a beg. No its close but uh... Kramer! Look I cant say anything. You know the guy told me the stuff in confidence Id be betraying a friend. Well you cant just mention it and then not tell me. Alright. Ill tell you but you cant say anything to him. Im not saying anything Im putting it in the vault Im locking the vault its a vault! He thinks youre a phony. He what? I told you he thinks youre a phony. A phony? He called me a phony? A big phone. A big one. Why did you tell me that if I cant say anything?! You begged me. Do you hear that? Of course I hear that. You had to move the mirror? I wanted to check out my sunglasses. I went to look in the mirror it wasnt there. You threw off my equilibrium. Oh yeah blame it on me because you cant drive George. I cant drive? Yeah. Nobody drives like me. Nobody. Im doing things in this car you have no idea theyre going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this. No I really dont. And I can make a left turn from the right lane too. Im sure you could. What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car? I dont know. Alright start looking for spaces. Oh youre never gonna find a space on Jerrys block just put it in a garage. Look I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door then I slowly expand out in concentric circles. Oh come on George please put it in a garage. I dont want to spend an hour looking for a space. I cant park in a garage. Why? I dont know I just cant. Nobody in my family can pay for parking its a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother my brother nobody. We cant do it. Ill pay for it. You dont understand. A garage. I cant even pull in there. Its like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay when if I apply myself maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me Im looking for spaces. (pointing backwards) Oh George theres a space right there! (putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that the dream space right in front of Jerrys building. Huh? Dreams can come true what did I tell you? You didnt even have to take it out to dinner. Alright now youre gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) Its all geometry knowing all the angles when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in thats the key. Will you just park it already? Theres nothing I can even impart to you thats the sad thing. Its so inborn I cant pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy what are you doing?! Hey! Hey youre stealing my space! George wait you dont know who this guy is people kill for a parking space in this city. No no no hes not getting away with this. George? Hey what are you doing? I think Im parking my car. You cant do that you cant just sneak in from the back like that. Im not sneaking. I didnt even know you were parking you were just sitting there three spaces up. Well if you didnt think I was parking why did you put it in head first? Well thats the way I park. Anyway you didnt start backing in until I pulled in. I was in the middle of a conversation. Hey buddy what can I tell you? The point is I was here first. I was closer to this space than you were. But Im backing in! You cant put it in head first! I can if I have room! Are you gonna move the car? No Im not gonna move the car. Jerk! Oh youre not? Do you believe this guy? Come on well put it in a garage. I am not putting it in a garage its my space.

Alright just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car? Me? No no no you. Youre gonna tell him. Im not gonna tell- Noo. Oh come on youre good at this. What am I gonna say? I dont know I dont know youll think of something. Oh god I need a drink do you got any Hennigans here? Yeah under the counter. What happened? Oh god. Oh Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldnt believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter) (bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened. (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway okay?! And there were these like this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us okay?! And for some reason I dont know they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll and then we went through and then they started to follow us alright?! So George tries to lose them and and but they were in this really like a souped up car you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then George is such a great driver. He is? Oh he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air. A gun?! I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home. My god are you okay? Yeah yeah Im alright. Oh by the way the car hit a pothole and now its making a clanking noise. Well I mean as long as youre okay that thats the important thing. Exactly. Wheres George now? Oh hes out in front of the building. Hes arguing with some guy about a parking space. What are you talking about? Look out the window youll see. (leaning out the window) Hey Georgie! Hey! Are you okay? Yeah Im fine. Crazy kids huh? What? (desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) Its my cuticle. Is that Jerry? Jerry?! Oh hey Mike. What you know Jerry? Yeah I know Jerry. How do you know him? Whats the difference? Because I know him too and probably a lot better than you. Well bully for you. Hey Jerry! You know your friend heres a real piece of work! Im coming down. Hey will you tell Kramer Im outside? What you know Kramer?! Hi. (acting standoffish) Hello. Hey your friend Mikes outside he wants to talk to you. (out the window) Hey Mike! Come on up the fights almost starting! And youre watching the fight at Jerrys? Yeah. Oh great. You know that guy downstairs? Yeah hes a real phony. Whats going on?! Hey will you come on down? This guys in my space! Its my space! Ill be down in a minute. Are you going down? Yeah. Is anything wrong? (leaving) Why should anything be wrong? (heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute. Hey pal youre not getting that space. I mean Ill sleep in my car if I have to. Ill die out here. Hey! Jerry! Long time no see! Hi Mike. (Noticing Georges fedora) Indiana. Hey Krame! You know this guy? Yeah yeah I know him. (to Jerry) Youre looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen? Yeah twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me they take it down another fifteen percent. (laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! Thats killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that thats a definite!! Ha ha ha!!! Oh come on. Hey! Your friend here has some real problems. Me? You see what he did here you see how he tried to sneak into my space? Hey just cause I went in front first doesnt mean Im sneaking in. You only went in front first cause you saw me backing up and you didnt have room to parallel park! I only went in front first cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out Ill show you! Youve got a prayer. I go in front first all the time. Front first thats how you park when youre pulling a bank job. Did you talk to him? Yeah its all taken care of. You told him? What did you tell him? I did a number on him it was a thing of beauty you really had to have been there to appreciate it. I dont believe it what did you say? I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city. A pack of teenagers? Yeah by the time I got to the end of the story he was to relieved that we were alive he couldnt care less about the car. You are a genius its as simple as that. What can I say you know? Its a gift. I only wish I could teach it but you know its inborn. By the way thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market. What? Yeah Jerry he told me all about it. Oh great. I didnt know. Oh so thats why you were acting so funny. Well I didnt know you wanted to go to the flea market. A flea market? You went to a flea market?? Hey whos talking to you? We just didnt think of you. You said it sister. What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what Im doing? Great move telling him by the way real smart move. I didnt know I wasnt supposed to say anything! Judgement Jerry judgement! You exercised no judgement. Youre right. My fault. Kramer? Im so sorry really. Yeah Im sorry. Im sorry I dont care for that sorry. What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry was that a good sorry? It was a so-so sorry. Hey! Move this car I gotta get through! You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car. And like youre not gonna just back it in if I do that? Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here! You see they had to move the cars so the truck could get through right? But these guys dont trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them. Wild pack of teenagers huh? Yeah. Amazing how they picked you out of everyone to terrorize. Yeah. I know I said to myself Why us? You remember? Uh huh. Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering Well you know Its interesting you know under that pressure what youre capable of. Right. I learned a lot about myself. What did you do to my car?! I couldnt help it! Elaine moved the mirror I got discombobulated. Oh like youve ever been bobulated. I thought you said you were a good driver! No no I never said I was a good driver I said I was a good parker. I think you said driver. Parker I never said driver I said parker a great parker. Will you move it up a little bit? No no no thats in the right position. No no I was further in. No you werent. Stop there thats fine. Do you mind? Do you? Hey somebody better move these cars youre making a commotion. Hey Sid. Who are you? Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block everything gets disrupted and disjointed? Sid its completely his fault. Oh right. Why dont you start taking the bus? Okay George. Come on lets go. Im putting it in a garage. The fights starting in two minutes. Dont do it! What are we gonna do stay out here all night? Yes! Im not giving him the satisfaction its my space. Why dont you just flip a coin already? No no this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well Im making a stand here. Im saying *no* to head first parking. Im not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city were not putting up with head first parking. You know maybe if you hadnt been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were you might have got the space. So youre against me now? He could have pulled up to the car and backed in but he chose to go in head first. No he couldnt because the other car was already backing in. No he wasnt. All that matters is who was there first. Ahh youre not even old enough to drive you little puke. You just spit on me! Dont you raise your voice to me! Youre not my father. Hey Matthew. Hi Jerry. This guys really a jerk. How ya doing? Okay. Hey hows your father? I hear hes closing his store. What?! Oh no nothing. Whats happened to daddy? Hes going out of business? No no no no. Were not going to have any money? Were out of money? No of course not of course not! Mommy!? Jerry says daddys closing the store. Hes going out of business. We dont have any money? Jerry?! Whats the matter with you? I didnt-- (to Kramer) Boy I dont know about your friend Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes. Oh congratulations. What for? Well youre pregnant. What? Youre not pregnant? No Im not pregnant. Are you sure youre not pregnant? Yes Im sure! Thats weird. Come on Matthew. No. Come on Matthew! I thought she was pregnant. (to Elaine) Hey do you think Im phony? What? Mike thinks Im a phony. He thinks youre a phony? Yeah but I cant say anything because Kramer wasnt supposed to tell me. Oh you have to say something. I cant I told Kramer I was vaulting it. You gotta open the vault. Open my vault? Open your vault. Once I open the vault it ceases to be a vault. You have no choice. Oy ga-vault. When can you park head first? Never. What are you asking this guy for? Whos talking to you? Hes right. never. Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car? Well I suppose if you got ten car lengths. When do you ever have ten car lengths? What about Sundays and holidays? Oh please. Whats going on here? Oh this guy tried to sneak into my space. I really hate people who do that. I hope you dont let him get away with it. Well thank you for your support. Hey thats a great hat. Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today. Hey George nice hat. Yeah thanks. Can I try it on? No! It uh it wouldnt fit you. Well sure it would. No! Get out of here Newman. Come on let me try it on. No Newman stop it. Let him try it on. I dont want him to! What is wrong with you? You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat! Stop it George stop it. I was defending your parking. Alright just keep the hat! Alright thats it. The fights already started. Im going upstairs whos coming? Elaine? It depends on whos going. (to George) Are you going? Im not going if hes going. Me either. Im not going if hes going. Well Im going. Well if hes going then Im not going. But its your house. I still dont have to go. Well I dont want to go if Jerrys not going. Why wont you go if I go? Why? Ill tell you why. No. Dont Jerry. Like you didnt call me a phony? What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean you know when people say Hes bad it really means hes good sort of thing? You know slang. Use it in a sentence. Man that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Whyd you tell him?!? He begged me. He begged you?! Alright come on. Who wants to watch the fight? Officer could I just explain something to you? Officer he cant pull in head first. Officer he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked he was Well youre gonna have to go to the bathroom! Well youre gonna have to go to work! I dont have a job! Neither do I! Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*]
39,3,23,[Kramer what are you doing here!? Jerry now calm down its okay. Im sorry. I didnt want to wake you up! Yknow I was watching Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo and I - yknow I wanted to get some popcorn and I uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper. You scared me! Its just me. Thats enough! Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen grabs the popper drops the lid juggles it around then exits.) Cmon...cmon... Kramer! What are you doing?! What does it look like Im doing? What? Get out! Get out of the bathroom I gotta go! Alright alright... Cmon! Sorry. Move it! Move it! Get going! My drains all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel covered in soap suds.) Is that my towel? Im really happy the movie was sold out. Hey did you ever pretend theres like murderers chasing you and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment? Im from Witchita so... Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.) Hurry Jerry! Hes coming! Hurry! The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.) That was close! Did you see the look on that guys face? You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerrys bedroom laughing and horsing around.) Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?! Hey Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies. All right thats it. Hand em over. What? What you know what the keys. I want the keys. Youve lost your key privileges. Oh come on! No come on! What what I thought you went to the movies! It was sold out! Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out? Thats the point. What point? Just look just give the keys. Just give me another chance! Dont ask me! Im asking you! Im telling you. Youre joking. Im serious! Its not going to happen again! Yes it will now give me those keys! O.K. fine go ahead you take the keys! But youre going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes hes left his girlfriend in Jerrys apartment.) So put em in a safe place. I will. Where? I dont know. Ill hide em. So is Kramer upset? I think so. I mean hes acting really weird lately...hes different. Well maybe you should just give him the keys back. I cant. Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.) Whos there? Uh Kramer. (Jerry opens the door Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh hi...uh...you got the... Oh Im not uh... No no no its o.k. I dont care about the keys. Its my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke the covenant of the keys. Jerry give him the keys back. Elaine... I dont want the keys back! No Im glad the way things turned out. I was clingin to those keys man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And Im free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you. Take the keys. I dont want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer but Kramer refuses.) O.K.! Now one more thing - I would like my keys back. Your spare set? Thats right. You want em back? Yeah. Yeah I think it would be for the best. Gee Kramer I uh...I dont know what to say. Say yes! Yes George. Yes! Should I give you my keys is that the transaction trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys. Well you can get em back. I suppose I could. Because you see George having the keys to Jerrys apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house it was like I was on vacation. Better food better view better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because Im looking at life you see through Jerrys eyes. I was living in twilight George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you. Me? Oh yeah. I can barely see you George. Alright stop it Kramer youre freakin me out. (The waitress comes over.) Hi are you ready to order? (George tries to order but Kramer interrupts.) Do you ever yearn? Yearn? Do I yearn? I yearn. You yearn. Oh yes. Yes I yearn. Often I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned? Well not recently. I craved. I crave all the time constant craving...but I havent yearned. Look at you. Aw Kramer dont start... Youre wasting your life. I am not! What you call wasting I call living! Im living my life! O.K. like what? No tell me! Do you have a job? No. You got money? No. Do you have a woman? No. Do you have any prospects? No. You got anything on the horizon? Uh...no. Do you have any action at all? No. Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning? I like to get the Daily News! George its time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys. Why? Im goin to California. You know I got the bug. Yeah I think I got a touch of something too. No the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie. These pretzels are making me thirsty? That was one line! You got fired! I know I know but man! I never felt so alive! Now are you coming with me? Uh no Im not. Alright suit yourself. But lets keep this between us - were key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.) Youre not really gonna go to California are you? Up here Im already gone. (Kramer exits.) Anyway so he gave me his spare keys now he wants to have my keys so I need mine back from you. Just cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours? I dont know. He said he wants to be my key brother. Thats ridiculous. Thats Kramer. Ill give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back. What for? Cause. Ill give em to Jerry. Jerry? Why? Cause he gave me his. So what? So if he has my keys I should have his. Well I dont see why if you have his he should have yours. I just said the same thing to you. What? What? Alright listen Ill give you your spare keys but I dont have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer? Yeah O.K. Ill go get em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaines counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends. Did you bring the keys? Yes but I still dont feel right about letting you into Kramers apartment without his permission. This could be an emergency! You never should have taken away his keys! I tried to give em back he wouldnt take em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramers apartment.) Howd the Mets do? They lost. Kramer? Hello boys. Hello Newman. You lookin for someone? Dont play coy with me Newman Im not in the mood! Coy? Im not being coy. Is he being coy? Yeah coy. Youre being coy. Now wheres Kramer Newman? Who? Listen Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now! Alright go ahead and hit me Seinfeld. I got witnesses. Turn around George. Sure. (Turns around.) George? Now you better tell me where Kramer is or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.) Help! Help! Wheres Kramer? HELP! (Elaine enters.) Whats going on? Theyre gonna beat me up! No were not. Were trying to find out what happened to Kramer. You wanna know what happened to Kramer? Ill tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah thats right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap. Bad rap? Yeah. From you. Me? You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A. L.A.? I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldnt take em back. Elaine you saw it remember? I said Take the keys back. He wouldnt do anything. You saw it didnt you see it? Yeah yeah I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean its complete bullshit. Huh? What...? No whatd you say? Nothing. I didnt say anything. Oh you didnt see it. Yeah I saw it. I saw it! I did I saw it. Yep. I heard you say something there. I didnt say anything. Im calling Kramers mother. (Picks up the phone dials.) (To Elaine) I dont know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down! Ask her about Kramer. Shes drunk out of her mind. Elaine? Are you there? Its me Im locked out of my apartment I need my spare keys. Where are you? Im at the coffee shop. Hey! You ever been in an accident? About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day going about the same speed Im going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldnt have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike went flyin about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey you know when they found me my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well they told me about a year...said Id be a vegetable for life. Yeah but I showed em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.) Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down Im buying you dinner. Look I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin about it I just dont feel right about letting you into Elaines apartment. Dont feel right? What are you talking about? Well you know I shouldnt have let you into Kramers now you want to go into Elaines...she entrusted me with her spare keys how can I just let you in? What is the big deal? Just because you have someones spare keys it doesnt entitle you to break into their apartment. Thats the reason you took away Kramers keys. First of all youre not even supposed to have Elaines keys. Youre supposed to give em back to her so she can give em back to me because she has mine. So technically those are my keys. Yes well if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer he never would have taken his back from you and given em to me in which case I wouldnt have had to take mine back from her. Well I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.) Nope no can do. George give them to me I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I dont want to get physical! Do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight? Ill fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.) And then the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince. Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel cruel world. Oh hes cold. Yeah yeah...thatd be funny. (To driver) Hey you can drop me here! Well you know I gotta be goin now. What do you think junior? You think these hands have been soakin in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody) Dont you see? Youre just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys so she was gonna give em to me. So all thats happening is that instead of giving them to her youre giving them to me. Its just unfortunate that when she gave you yours you didnt give her hers. Cause then she would have given em to me because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers so that I could get mine. Youre right how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door mutters under his breath) Maybe because its a crock of shit. Whats that? Nothing. I heard something. Didnt say anything. (They go into Elaines apartment.) So how long you been drivin this thing? Goin on four years. Well nothins sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi. Nothin? (They exchange a glance then laugh.) Listen to you youre quite the sweet-talker. You know I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle. You want to give it a try? Really? Do you know how to double-clutch? Yeah. Well come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol double-clutch.) They were in here I saw her put em in here! Well this is great. Well what do they look like? They look like keys George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) What do they look like. Well theyre obviously not here. Well theyve gotta be here somewhere. Jerry unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up we have checked every square inch of this apartment! What is this? Murphy Brown? What? By Elaine Benes? What? Elaines writing a Murphy Brown? Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.) Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.) Gimme half! All right here! Why didnt she tell us? Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.) You weasels! What? What? How dare you! We hardly read anything! It was funny! Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny? Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw... Well its just a first draft! I was locked out of my apartment Im just trying to get my keys. Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.) He forced me to! I did not! Yes you did! You! Get out! Get out! Get out! Elaine wait! I need my spare keys! Here! Heres your damn keys you keep em! I dont want em anymore! Good! And I want my keys back from you! What you dont want me to hold your keys? No you cant be trusted! Alright alright fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.) And I dont want you to hold mine! Good! I wont! Good! Dont! Are these my keys? These arent my keys! Whose are these? I dont know! I just thought I could write it. Is that something you want to do? I dont know. Those writers make a lot of money. Elaine let me tell you something about show business. Its hard work! You dont just write a Murphy Brown. You gotta watch the show study it get a sense of the characters how they relate to each other. O.K. can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God what an asshole. What did you say? I didnt say anything. I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine Elaine! Its Kramer! Kramers on Murphy Brown! Kramers on Murphy Brown! Look there he is hes sittin at the desk! Hi Im Murphy Brown you must be my new secretary. Oh good morning Miss Brown. And you are...? Oh Im uh Steven Snell. Snell. Well hello Mr. Snell. Steven. Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system? Oh - Im familiar with it. Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.)]
40,4,1,[Kramer was on Murphy Brown? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. Murphy Brown the TV show. Cmon will ya? Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun! Something isnt it? With Candace Bergen! I know! Ive always liked her. Remember her in Carnal Knowledge? Sure. Did she show her breasts in that? Shes not really the naked type. I cant believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California. He did? Yeah I turned him down. How come you didnt tell me? He asked me to keep it a secret. But you can never keep a secret. I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds. Well youve come a long way. Ive matured. Hey listen the Tonight Show called me they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and theyre giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go? A free ticket? Yeah in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys. What about accommodations? All taken care of. Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh do I need a hat? I need a hat dont I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now that looks very cool to me... So my acting technique my personal acting technique is working with color imagining color then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See if you look through my scripts youll see that all my lines have a special color so I dont memorize language I memorize color. This way I can go through red yellow green blue. And I have a full palette of emotions. Hey didnt I tell you to get out of here? Uh did you? Cmon lets go. Well I was just-- Yeah yeah you were just nothing. Cmon lets go. Alright well talk about this a little later. Are you an actor? Murphy Brown. Uh yeah uh Candace Bergen please. Whos calling please? Ah well just tell her that its Kramer. Alright Ill uh Ill call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead its all yours. Hello Kramer. Oh uh Helena how are you? I havent worked since 1934 how do you think I am? Well thats only uh 58 years. It was a Three Stooges short Sappy Pappy. I played Mr. Sugarmans secretary remember? Yeah right right yeah yeah that was a Shemp right? No a Curly.

Well I dont remember that part. I play Mr. Sugarmans secretary. Oh yeah yeah you were you were very good. Yeah it was sad for a Three Stooges what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all. Well that was an unusual choice for the stooges. Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store Kramer? Uh well uh you know I cant right now you know uh I got a very big meeting I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So uh I guess well have to make it another time alright? Well No! No dont go out there Kramer theyll hurt you theyll destroy you.

What is this? What? Were going on a two day trip what are you Diana Ross? I happen to dress based on mood. Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time. Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations only discernable to an acute observer that reflect the many moods the many shades the many sides of George Costanza. (referring to Georges outfit): And what mood is this. This is Morning Mist. Look at this guy hes like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine wont detect him. Personally Im a little nervous about going through these things. Im afraid Im gonna step through into another dimension. Just go. Heh he I made it. Empty your pockets please. Walk through again please. Are you sure you dont have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets? Anklets? A lot of men wear anklets. Really? Yeah. What do you have in your bag sir? My bag?

Cause I can uh show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money. Really. Yeah theyre trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun only that she was Hitlers girlfriend. Um-hm. What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on... Wait wait hold it hold it. Look whos over there. Dont look dont look! Its Fred Savage. Big deal. Hed be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there I gotta give him a copy of my treatment. Why are you breathing so hard? Well Im just a little nervous. OK I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck huh? Hey. Oh did I frighten you? Im not crazy. I mean I may look weird but Im just like you Im just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work the uh... Thank you. Yeah I cant remember the name of it.

Well what did you want her to do you left it on the night table. Theyre not supposed to just take everything and throw it out! Hey hey hey! Its not Lupes fault you shouldnt have left it out. Alright just get your thing together and lets get out of here. Alright now. What mood am I in what mood am I in? You shouldnt have tucked. I like it tucked. Nobody tucks anymore. Hey Lieutenant.

How ya doing? Big fan! Big fan. Yeah. Hey you grew a beard huh? Yeah yeah. Im doing a movie during my hiatus. Hey. You know do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law. Really. ...so mind you at this point Im only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time theres a lot of stuff going on in my life and uh it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week five six days. Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened? Well its the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board. So you killed the cat. Thats what she says. I say listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen honey. First of all it was a pretty old cat. Im not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all I go out to the garbage I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me like uh I dunno get the hell out of here and she breaks up with me. Now dont you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law? I dont wanna tell you how to run your show. Oh of course not. But really its enough with the bar already. Yeah well. Seriously have they though about changing the setting? Doubt it I doubt it. Yeah. Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar huh? Well yeah they do heh heh. What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center. Yeah you oughta write one of those. Yeah? Yeah Ill bring it up with the producers I gotta... uh... Fabulous Ill think about that George thank you! Hows it going? Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt. Really? Yeah yeah not fan talk not gushing you know? Actual conversation I was incredibly articulate! You got toilet paper on your heel there. Oh yeah yeah people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law just a few seconds ago right here right outside in the hallway this nut some sick nut comes up to me and says hes supposed to watch this girls cat while shes away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat the cat dies starves to death he kills the cat refuses to get her a new one wont give her any money wont pay her and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah thatd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot. Hes a very handsome man. Passionate intense but troubled strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course theres nothing abnormal about that I have many suitors. Its funny cause even after all these years we still get people giving us advice how to improve the show. Actually a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there he said you know that maybe we should think about you know not doing the show in a bar. So thats when I said Hey Kramer dude. You ever killed a man before? And he said What do you think Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid? The guy you talked to what did he look like? Short little bald guy with glasses. Yeah yeah thats the same guy I talked to. It never ends does it? So Im going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh uh the uh that uh the conveyor belt. Issue an arrest warrant put out an APB. Lets pick up this uh Kramer. I was terrible. What are you crazy? You were fine. Nah did you hear the end? I couldnt remember what I was trying to say that whole thing about the uh... Conveyor belt. Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin. I cant believe youre blaming Lupe? Yes Lupe. Im blaming Lupe. Our top story tonight there has been a break in the so called Smog Stranglings. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as Kramer.]

Im not interested in your explanations Kramer! Sure I bet youve got a million of em. Maybe your mother didnt love you enough maybe the teacher didnt call on you in school when you had your little hand raised maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants huh? Well Ive got another theory youre a weed. No... Society is filled with them. Theyre choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.

(singing) cause the murderer struck again! So Kramer what are you going to do? Do? Do? Hey Im doing what I do. You know Ive always done what I do. Im doing what I do way Ive always done and the way Ill always do it. Kramer what the hell are you talking about? What do you want me to say? That the things havent worked out the way that I planned? That Im struggling barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That its a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That Im no better than a screenwriter driving a cab a starlet turning tricks a producer in a house he cant afford? Is that what you want me to say? Id like to hear that. Yeah... Well Im not saying that! You know things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl... Kramer she was murdered! Yeah well I wasnt looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV. As a suspect in a serial killing. Ok yeah you guys got to put a negative spin on everything. What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill I think its a dill. So youre not gonna come back to New York with us? No no Im not ready things are starting to happen. Taste this is this a dill? No its tarragon.

Stay in touch. Hey hey whoa come on give me a hug... Oh no... No youre crushing my sandwich. Yeah its so nice when it happens to you. Mint? No thanks. Ive got to tell you Im really disappointed in Lupe. Its been three days already forget about Lupe. Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home? No I dont. You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks throw in a few soaps. Yeah maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too. Ill tell you something if Id own a company my employees would love me. Theyd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home like Lenin. How much did you wound up tipping her? Oh my God I forgot! Well communism didnt work. Hey! Any mustard? This is empty. Yeah theres a new one in there. No no I dont like this one. Its too yellow. Any pickles? Help yourself. Yeah all right. Kramer what are you doing here? Getting something to eat. Kramer here!]
42,4,3,[What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war? What? I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860s. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags? Everything with you comes down to toilet paper. What? Thats always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus? All right so what did they do? I dont know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers. Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it. Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades the development of the perforation the first six-pack . . . Excuse me Jerry? Im Stu Chermak. Im with NBC. Hi. Could we speak for a few moments? Sure. Hi Jay Crespi. Hello. Uh C-R-E-S-P-I? Thats right. Im unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name. Mm Im not- George- (backing off) Huh? All right fine. First of all that was a terrific show. Oh thank you very much. And basically I just wanted to let you know that weve been discussing you at some of our meetings and wed be very interested in doing something. Really? Wow. So if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself well wed just love to talk about it. Id be very interested in something like that. Well here uh why dont you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series. Okay. Great. Thanks. It was very nice meeting you. Thank you. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. What was that all about? They said they were interested in me. For what? You know a TV show. Your own show? Yeah I guess so. They want you to do a TV show? Well they want me to come up with an idea. I mean I dont have any ideas. Come on how hard is that? Look at all the junk thats on TV. You want an idea? Heres an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And youre married. And your sons not interested in gymnastics and youre pushing him into gymnastics. Why should I care if my sons into gymnastics? Because youre a gymnastics teacher. Its only natural. But gymnastics is not for everybody. I know but hes your son. So what? All right forget that idea its not for you....Okay okay I got it. You run an antique store. Yeah and...? And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives. What person who runs an antique store gets involved in peoples lives? Why not? So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden Im getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows whats wrong with everybody that comes in. I know but antiques are very popular right now. No theyre not they used to be. Oh yeah like you know. Oh like you do. ...And youre the manager of the circus. A circus? Come on this is a great idea. Look at the characters. Youve got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean who wouldnt tune in to see a women with a moustache? Youve for the tallest man in the world; a guy whos just a head. I dont think so. Look Jerry the show isnt about the circus its about watching freaks. I dont think the network will go for it. Why not? Look Im not pitching a show about freaks. Oh come on Jerry youre wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a cant miss. Hello Newman. Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector. All right Ill be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits) Yeah sure. Whats this all about? Were making a trade. Im giving him my motorcycle helmet - hes giving me his radar detector. I didnt know you had a motorctcle. Well my girlfriend had one. You have a girlfriend? I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild. I never remember you with a girl. Nevertheless ... This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think youre cheating him. Dont say anything. All right. You know youre getting gypped over here. Really Ah We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? Thats a renege. Oh stop saying reneging. Well youre reneging. I Okay okay. Im not reneging. All right give it to me. let go ... You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items) Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots! Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits) Does that thing work? Nah. ... I just got a postcard from Elaine? Really? Yeah theyre in London now. Theyll be back in a few weeks. I cant believe she got involved with a shrink. So whats happening with the TV show? You come up with anything? No nothing. Why dont they have salsa on the table? What do you need salsa for? Salsa is now the number one condiment in America. You know why? Because people like to say salsa. Excuse me do you have salsa? We need more salsa. Where is the salsa? No salsa? You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) I wanted seltzer not salsa. Dont you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa! See this should be a show. This is the show. What? This. Just talking. (dismissing) Yeah right. Im really serious. I think thats a good idea. Just talking? Well whats the show about? Its about nothing. No story? No forget the story. Youve got to have a story. Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show. And who is on the show? Who are the characters? I could be a character. You? Yeah. You could base a character on me. So on the show theres a character named George Costanza? Yeah. Theres something wrong with that? Im a character. People are always saying to me You know youre a quite a character. And who else is on the show? Elaine could be a character. Kramer.. Now hes a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show. Right. And its about nothing? Absolutely nothing. So youre saying I go in to NBC and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing. We go into NBC. We? Since when are you a writer? (Scoffs) Writer. Were talking about a sit-com. You want to go with me to NBC? Yeah. I think we really go something here. What do we got? An idea. What idea? An idea for the show. I still dont know what the idea is. Its about nothing. Right. Everybodys doing something well do nothing. So we go into NBC we tell them weve got an idea for a show about nothing. Exactly. They say Whats your show about? I say Nothing. There you go. (Nodding) I think you may have something there. So the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you. (Thinks) No I dont think so. What do you mean you dont think so? I dont like it. I dont understand. What dont you like about it? I dont like the idea of a character based on me. Why not? well it just doesnt sit well. Youre my neighbor. Theres got to be a character based on you. Thats your problem buddy. I dont understand what the big deal is. Hey Ill tell you what - you can do it on one condition. Whatever you want. I get to play Kramer. You cant play Kramer. I am Kramer. But you cant act. Phew! Okay fine. Well use Newman. Newman? Nothin What do you want? Yeah. Thats strange. Thats queer uh? I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOURE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET. Yeah you better think again Mojumbo. Buyer beware. No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life. Karma Kramer? (To himself) Salsa seltzer. Hey excuse me you got any salsa? No not selzer salsa. (George doesnt react) Whats the matter? (Nervous) Nothing. You sure? You look a little pale. No Im fine. Im good. Im very good. What are you nervous? No not nervous. Im good very good. (A beat then he snaps) I cant do this! Cant do this! What? I cant do this! I cant do it. I have tried. Im here. Its impossible. This was your idea! What idea? I just said something. I didnt know you were going to listen to me. Dont worry about it. Theyre just TV executives. Theyre men with jobs Jerry! They wear suits and ties. Theyre married they have secretaries. I told you not to come. I need some water. I gotta get some water. Theyll give us water in there. Really? Thats pretty good. Oh God its Joe Devola. Who? This guys a writer hes a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine. Oh God he saw me. Hello Jerry. Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING? Youre under no obligation to shake my hand. Oh no Just a custom. Uh THATS MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD. Why shouldnt I look good? Oh no reason. Youre into karate right? You want to hit me? What are you doing here? I dreopped a script off. AH GOOD FOR YOU. Well ... You dont have to say anything. No Uh hey I guess Ill see you Sunday night. Why? Kramers party. Kramers ... having ... a ... party? No no hes not having a party. Hes doing something. I dont know what it is. Its nothing. Hes not doing anything. Gee I thought Kramer and I were very close friends. No Im sure you are. Im sure you are very close friends. Very close. Give my best to Hinckley. What was that? I cant believe what I just did. I didnt know kramer didnt invite him. I better call Kramer ... Theyre ready for you. Okay okay. Look you do all the talking okay? Relax. Who are they? Yeah theyre not better than me. Course not. Who are they? Theyre nobody. What about me? What about you? Why them? Why not me? Why not you? Im as good as them. Better. You really think so? No. (To Jerry laughing about one of his bits) The bit the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now thats funny. The parakeet in the mirror. Thats a good one Stu. Yeah its one of my favorites. What about you George? Have you written anything we might know? (Quickly making it up) Well possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show La Cocina. ..Actually it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef. Oh it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name? Pepe. Oh Pepe. Yeah Pepe. And uh he was making tamales. Oh he actually cooked on the stage? No no he mimed it. Thats what was so funny about it. So what have you two come up with? Well weve thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself- (Interrupting) May I? Go ahead. I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING. Nothing? (Smiling) Nothing. (Unimpressed) What does that mean? The show is about nothing. (To George) Well its not about nothing. (To Jerry) No its about nothing. Well maybe in philosophy. But even nothing is something. Mr. Dalrymple your niece is on the phone. Ill call back. (Obviously dislikes George) Not even close. Is it with a y? No. Whats the premise? ..Well as I was saying I would play myself and as a comedian living in New York I have a friend a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend which is all true. Yeah but nothing happens on the show. You see its just like life. You know you eat you go shopping you read.. You eat you read You go shopping. You read? You read on the show? Well I dont know about the reading.. We didnt discuss the reading. All right tell me tell me about the stories. What kind of stories? Oh no. No stories. No stories? So what is it? (Showing an example) Whatd you do today? I got up and came to work. Theres a show. Thats a show. (Confused) How is that a show? Well uh maybe something happens on the way to work. No no no. Nothing happens. Well something happens. Well why am I watching it? Because its on TV. (Threatening) Not yet. Okay uh look if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing then maybe this idea is not for you. I for one am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And Ill tell you something else this is the show and were not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right? (To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus.. I dont even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where where did you come up with that? Youre not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldnt even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. Thats the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you having conferences observing you like the way they did with the Elephant Man. Thats what Im talking about because thats the only way youre going to get better. . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute. Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman youre talking about? Yeah I thought I might give her a call. I I dont meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean weve been introduced. She knows my name. ITS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE! Why? Maybe she liked me. I I mean she was looking right at me. You know I think she was impressed. You know we had good eye contact the whole meeting. Oh I forgot to call Kramer. Wait a minute let me call Susan. No no this is more important. She might be leaving to work any minute. No I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party. No. What is it? I was just thinking about this patient of mine. What? Just wondering if hes taking his medication. Well come on were on vacation. Well we were standing uh inn the waiting area there and you know how Devola is. Hes all ... (buzzer) Yeah (to buzzer) (OC) Its George. And so uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party. Whoa back up a second. Well I didnt know that you didnt invite him. Why would you think I would invite him? I just a ssumed ... Assumed? Never assume anything. I dont want that nut in my house. You know hes on medication. Hello oh hello. You remember ... Susan from N B C. Of course. How are you? Fine its good to see you. And this is Kramer. Hello. All right go ahead Susan tell him. Tell me what? Well I (phone rings) Uh sorry Excuse me one second. Hello. Hi would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service. Oh gee I cant talk right now. Why dont you give me your home number and Ill call you later. Uh Im sorry were not allowed to do that. Oh I guess you dont want people calling you at home. No. Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up) Well go ahead tell him. Kramer are you drinking that milk? Yeah. Whats the expiration date on that? September third. The third? and SUSAN: The third? Um Uh ugh ... Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan) I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didnt see it coming. I think SHE saw it coming. You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. Thats what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me. Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesnt mean the deal is dead. What are you crazy? Its a traumatic thing to be thrown up on. Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia. Chamberlind you could hold his head in nthe toilet hed still give you half of Europe. What happened to you? Devola came after me. What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I cant believe this. What happened? Can I have a coffee. ... What you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down I look up and its Crazy Joe Devola. And he says Thats what I thin k of your party. Boy that is some kick. Well yeah Newmans helmet it saved my life. Look at that. Wow Newmans helmet. Holly. I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says youre next. Me why? He doesnt like you. What does he want from me? I didnt do anything. See this is all Elaines fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably cant get his medication. Now I got some nut after me. Pass the cream. Wait a second. (smells it). all right.]

What about him? You just said Yo-yo Ma. Whats Yo-yo Ma? Hes a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today. All right come on come on lets go. Six dollars. I cant believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill. I know! That doesnt really bode well for the show does it? The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network Oh yeah. Right. Like anybodys ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing! It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now if he hadnt vomitted all over her wed be writing it right now. Jeez! Anyway. (interrupts) What are you doing? Whats wrong with you? Whatre you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down Ill make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! Im sorry. No thats my next door neighbor. Hes not quite himself. He got kicked in the head.

Fifty sixty thousand? I dont know about sixty. Oh its gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes huh? Ted Danson! Now how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?

Thats it for this piece of junk! Ive had it. What is that the one your parents gave you? Yeah! But it never works. You know were supposed to be there by two oclock. We should take a cab. All right well be a little late Im not taking a cab. Ill pay for it. Its not the money! Well what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience? Jerry! Uncle Leo! Helloooo! Hello there howre you doing? Ha ha! How are you? Good good. Hows your mom and dad? Good fine. What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I dont hear from you anymore! Oh no. Ive been kinda busy. Its all. You know where I just came from? (not enthousiastic at all) Oh sure. Danny. He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time! Oh yeah yeah. I remember. The funny thing is: I cant wear em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway Danny says to me: You need any pajamas? (interrupts) I-Im sorry Uncle Leo I really gotta get going. Oh. Well. You gotta get going so go. We we got a big meeting with the president of NBC. Nobody got a gun to your head! (seems sincere) Yeah Im really sorry uh. Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment go to your appointment. Im sorry really. You know I know plenty of people in Hollywood too! Sorry really. (from inside) Yeah? Come on are you ready? Lets go! For what? Whats the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago. what about? The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. Im contesting a ticket today. I cant Im going to the doctors later. You gotta go with me. I mean you-youre my alibi. You have to take the stand. Well I cant! Well let me remind you of something. You wouldnt be here if it wasnt for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldnt even begin to comprehend what that means!! Shut up! Ill get my coat! Dont step on anything. You see the look on my uncles face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You cant leave. Theres no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives. I didnt shave this morning. I dont feel like myself. You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. Im sorry Uncle Leo theres a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running. Hell go: Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If thats what you have to do. Look at this. Why didnt you shave this morning? Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon. Why? Because of the day before. Its a long story. Is that Joe Davola? Its not him! I cant live tlike this. Im being stalked. Oh. Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? Im not here? All right. Look. Now you promised youre gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea okay? Jsut a little. Okay. A little. Okay youre all set? You got your story? No. When the cop stopped me I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide. Uhm... Now youre that firend. Now all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide. I never had an air conditioner. No! Thats no reason to kill yourself! Why? It gets hot at night you cant sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room? Every night I sleep in a really hot room I dont want to kill myself. Well I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself. No no no. Thats not gonna work. Something else. I was never able to become a banker. Banker! So youre killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you cant live without being a banker. Yeah yeah. If I cant be banker I dont wanna live. You must be banker. MUST be banker. Okay well go with the banker story. The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise its just masturbation. And people really have to care about the characters. Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise why would they keep tuning in? Wouldnt tune in. Would they tune in? No tune. We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down. The show will be like a heart attack! Just a huge massive coronary. So what you said last week about no story youre a little flexible on that now. Is-is that what I said no story? Because Jerry had to tell me later. He couldnt believe it. (Laughs snorts) I said I said: Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said? And then what happened? Look. I dont know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you. Well we would like to be in business. Lets do business. Well have some business. Lets have business. We would love to be in business. Well do business. Were in business. Its... its business. This is business. Yeah! Your off-Broadway play. Oh oh. Uh you know. Its the damndest thing. I uh I moved recently and my files pfff disappeared. Now I-I dont know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. Im not through with that moving company. (backs his story) Hmm hmm. Thats my vow to you. Well I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that ladys judgment. Oh! Thats good judgment. Thats a pile of judgment there. Sure. Oh! Tahts judgment. Yes yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah. (gets up) So lets make a pilot. I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker. I dont understand. You see itd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturers Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well Your Honor he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say... (interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma! So I sped home to save my friends life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes I admit I was speeding but it was to save a mans life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love to be loved and to be a banker. So then he didnt kill himself. No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. Hes in the courtroom today See? Yeah! I told you I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh! Now all we gotta do is write it. Yes! Howre we gonna do that? Hey! Congratulations! Thanks. Oh thank you. Thank you thanks. Thanks. Gee you know I thought you were mad at me. No. Phone call? Who knows Im here? When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didnt have a chance. Oh it was only vomit. Anyway I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning. Oh no-no its okay. *comment from transcriber: yeah she doesnt want to be paid didnt she send the bill?* No-no-no we all chipped in. We have the money. Well it was eighteen dollars. Okay uh eighteen dollars and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend. Yeah. Call me. All right great. Bye. Bye thanks. (chuckles) Bye thanks. (To Jerry when Susan is far) I cant believe she took the money. Why? I offered to pay. She shouldve said no. She did you insisted. Maybe this is what the pilot should be about vomiting on somebodys vest. Nah! How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty sixty thousand? oh I d-I dont know. I d--- Oh gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer. Okay. (excited pushing Jerry forward) All right lets go lets go lets go come on. Thirteen thousand? Thirteen thousand. a piece? No for both! Thats insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode. Oh would you stop with the Ted Danson? Well he does. Youre nuts! Im sorry. I cant live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he? Hes somebody. What about me? Youre nobody. Why him? Why not me? Hes good youre not. Im better than him. Youre worse much much worse. (crouches in booth) Thats Davola! (crouches too) What? Where? Where? Outside! I saw him outside! what is it? Oh its this patient. (sighing) Again? Im fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication. Well so he can live without his Valium for a couple of days. Nah you dont understand. He could be dangerous. Go outside and see if hes still there. I cant go out there he knows were friends. Well what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor. Tell the cop. Good idea. Yeah all right. Just let me get a muffin. Thanks. (back in booth) Hes gonna get a muffin and then hell walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life. I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin. (bossy) What are you doing? What? What are you ordering food now? Yeah! Yeah I decided to get a sandwich. What happened to the muffin? I got a little hungry. All of a sudden you get hungry? Yeah! You got a problem with that? No! Enjoy your lunch. I thought he was just gonna have a muffin. All of a sudden he gets hungry. You know a muffin can be very filling. I know! (interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th? What do you mean my own words? Whose words are they gonna be? You know what I mean. (to Judge) I was very upset that day. And why was that? (to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk! All right all right. Go ahead go ahead. All right. Okay. (to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker. And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside. (not convincing) Uh yeah. It was your family that pushed you into banking  it was their dream for you... Mister Newman. Your Honor Im only trying to establish Mister Kramers fragile emotional state my entire case depends on it. Uh continue. As you were saying Mister Kramer... What was the question? Youre telling how your parents pushed you into banking. Uh well my father when I was a kid he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: Sonny boy take a good look at him thats gonna be you some day. But you never became a banker did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail? I dont know. It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isnt THAT true? Uh could you get to the speeding? Yuh yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then on the afternoon of September 10th you received a phone call did you not? (puzzled) Phone call? Yes a phone call! From who? From me! From you? Yes from me!! I called you remember? You called me? Yes I called you you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember? what? You were going to... Im afraid Im gonna have to call a--- Yes the banker!!! What banking? A banker! A banker! Your Honor Your Honor Your Honor... Thats enough already. Your Honor Mister Kramers obviously very distraught. Im distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo! (to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure. Thatll be seventy-five dollars. (Strangling Kramer) Whats the matter with you? We had it all worked out! Do you see him? Im not* sure. Well either you see him or you dont. All right. I dont. (looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think hes getting coffee.! Whats with this guy? (still bossy) Did you just order coffee? Yeah. This is really too much. What is your problem? Well Im sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now youre drinking coffee thats gonna be another ten minutes. Well youre just gonna have to wait. Never said anything about the banking. Youre off your rocker. Hey you guys! Hey! What are you doing here? What are YOU doing here? Hey is Davola outside? Davola? Yeah. No I didnt see him. Crazy Joe Davola? (reading the tabs) Jerry yours is eleven dollars. Eleven dollars for what? Muffin sandwich and coffee! (to Kramer) Hey NBC okayed our idea. Were gonna make the pilot. Youre gonna do the circus freak show uh? No. Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand? Whats the difference? The money is not important. (looking outside) Hey Newman is that your red car? Yeah. I think youre getting a ticket. Deh! Run run! Go go go! Hey! What are you doing? Its after six oclock! You cant give me a ticket! Hey youre not gonna get away with this. Ill fight this. I got witnesses. I saw the whole thing! Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot. Ah get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier. Oh like you know what youre talking about! No YOU do!]

You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out. (scratches chin nose then covers eyes with hands) How high did I go? You almost did the nose. What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George) What? Im not eating bread now. Im off bread. (To George) Youre off bread. (To Elaine) So what happened is it over? No not quite. Why not? Well he was my psychiatrist you know. I mean he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave and so he says as my doctor he cant allow me to do this so hes not letting me leave. What do you mean - Not letting you? He has this power over me okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. Hes like a Svenjolly. Svengali. What did I say? Svenjolly. Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly. George? Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger) I dont see how I could have said Svenjolly. Well maybe hes got like a cheerful mental hold on you. You know I cant find a match anywhere. You know what you should do? You should tell this guy youre seeing  somebody else. Thats the easiest way to get out of these things. No its not going to work with this guy. No you just tell him ah an old boyfriend has come back into your life. I dont think so. Nice try. Took a shot. This is a good cigar (hair is on fire white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom) So when do I get to see the doctor? Hell be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves) (checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door shouts into the hallway) MY WALLETS GONE!

Oh oh no no no no I cant do that. You can do it and you will do it. No I cant. You can and you will. Okay okay. Yeah Ill have Kramer give you a call. So you didnt even let the doctor treat you? I wouldnt give him the satisfaction. Why did you leave your wallet in your pants? What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere? You couldve taken it with you. Oh yeah Ill be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth. Hello... Hi Uncle Leo. I just talked to Dr. Dembrows son. He said they almost had to call the police. What are you talking about? Im the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet. You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You cant just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor. All right Leo. And you walked out without paying. How was I supposed to pay? I didnt have my wallet. Well I hope you send him a check. What for? What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor. Thats the second time you said personal favor. Why do you keep saying that? I said it once. Twice! And Dembrow doesnt even know you. His son happens to live on your floor. Leo where did you get that watch? You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch? Morty doesnt that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry. Hey wheres the waiter. Dad what say we have some red meat tonight. Lets live a little. . Let me see that. Could we continue this another time.]
45,4,6,[(to Leo) I dont understand this jeweller Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.

Shes beautiful. Shes not beautiful. I think shes beautiful. So you ask her out. Im not gonna ask her out. Why not? If you dont think shes beautiful theres something wrong with you. Shes pretty. Shes not beautiful. I should drop dead if shes not beautiful. I think thats a little extreme. (grudgingly) Shes awright. (oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week and him a day. How could that be? Somethings fishy about this. He said what? The hell with them. The hell with them? Those were his exact words. (worried) Oh boy. He said Weve got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys who have no idea and no experience more money? (still worried) He was pretty emphatic? Pounded on his desk. Pounded? (tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer. (getting animated) Look I I uh I had nothing to do with this. It wasnt my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. Im the creative guy. He handles the business end. You said it was insulting. I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? Im never insulted. You could call me baldy dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me. Well theres nothing I can do. Well dont they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just he says no and thats it?

You didnt ... (makes motion like hes lighting a cigar) My Cubans! (runs off to the burning cabin)]
47,4,8,[She hasnt told her father yet? No. Were supposed to tell him tonight. Were? What do you mean Were? Susan wants me to be there. Youre meetin the father for the first time? (Reluctantly) Yeah. (Chuckles slightly) Well youll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down. I didnt burn it down - Kramer did! (Laughs) I mean the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars.. Yeah I know what happened. No but wait wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer.. (Getting frustrated) I know. (Continuing) ..Who who proceeds to burn the mans cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) Its very comical.. Listen maybe we shouldnt start writing today. I got a lot on my mind. (Persisting) No no we put this off long enough. Todays the day. (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susans fathers going to react to this. Alright what- whats the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down.. (Agreeing) Cmon. Its not even a house - its like a cabin. We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that. (Blunt) Well maybe not us but two men could. (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What dja get bics? What you got a problem with the pen now? Well I like a rolling writer. Theyre very smooth. Alright lets just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot Seinfeld project. Act I Scene A. (Still standing) So youre gonna sit there? (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I Scene A. (Offering) Drink? No no thank you. (Uncapping his pen) Alright here we go. Act I Scene A.. Werent you supposed to call Elaine? (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi is Elaine there? Oh uh Hi Sandra. Uh yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for like twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh hi Sandra. Listen Im at a pay phone and theres lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) Ill be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George picking his teeth with his finger is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen Elaine is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for like twenty minutes. (Pause) So were on for later? Yeah Ill come by after work. Hey I got a rubber pencil thing happenin here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi can you come here for a second? Okay lets go. (George shuts the television off ready to work) Alright here we go. You got it? Yeah. Here we go. Okay how about this: Im in my apartment you come in. (Holding out his arms - giving praise) Its beautiful. Now what do I say? Could you do me a favor? Um when my friends call could you not talk to them for too long? Why? Did Jerry say something? No no. He must have said something. Oh no he didnt say anything. (Near tears) I cant work for you! I cant. Im leaving. (Exits quickly) (Calling out to Sandra) No Sandra. Im sorry Im sorry! I really am! Listen listen Jerrys under a lot of pressure right now. Its very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they dont laugh! Alright lets go. Here we go. Hey. yeah Kramer were uh kind of in the middle of something here. Were trying to do a little work.. Yeah come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) Whats with you? (Complaining) No more golf. Why? Well you remember I told you about the pro you know at the Westchester Country Club whos letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars? Yeah. (Angered) Yeah well I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch he addresses George) Hey George maybe you can ask Susans father for more huh? What are you Crazy? I cant ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin! Why? Whats one thing got to do with another? Kramer please. Well I cant go back to the public courses now. I cant! I wont. I mean you know what thats like? Its crowded the grass has big brown patches in it they dont rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with! Kramer I cant help you. Youre gonna have to get them some place else. (Opening the door) Where? Theyre Cubans. (Leaves) (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off. What?! Well you know I gotta go to uh Susans parents house for dinner.. and you know I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time. (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script? I think we got a bite on it. (Exits) (To Mr. Ross) Doesnt George look like your sister Sarah? (Gruff) A slight resemblance. (To George) Her sons a podiatrist you know. Ohh I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean to dedicate yourself to the foot - youre toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean.. How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you? Oh uh the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) Im uh suckin em down. Im puffing my brains out yeah. You know those cigars are made special for Castro? (Impersonating Carson) I didnt not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh) What? (Explaining) Hes doing Johnny Carson daddy. I didnt care much for his jokes. (To George) Daddy never laughs. Oh well so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean what is the point of opening your mouth and going Ha ha!? What is that? Ha ha!? You know you cant get those cigars anywhere. You and your cigars.. (Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick. Daddy theres um theres something that we have to talk to you about.. Oh I forgot to ask you - howd you like the cabin? (Even more nervous than before) Oh the uh the cabin.. well (Clears throat) Right after we get off the phone then you go and tell her that?! Well of course she knows it was me who complained! Now Im responsible for this womans quitting. Oh this is unbelievable! (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. Its all my fault. Would you call her? (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone and starts to dial) How could you do this? (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you. (Muttering) Oh just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi uh this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen I - I just want to tell you (Jerry sternly grabs Elaines hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) Theres been a terrible misunderstanding: See I told Elaine that uh it was a real treat talking to you on the phone and she thought I was being sarcastic you know cause Im a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) Yeah it was a real treat talking to her on the phone. (Back to normal) You know but I was really being sincere.. No of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um uh hold on a second. (To Elaine whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out Just go while making gestures. Jerry again gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah I think I can.. Um.. yeah I know where that is.. Ok.. uh Ill see you there. Okay bye. (Hangs up peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her. The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news then decides to pass it off) Susan? Uhh.. about the cabin.. (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were (Mrs. Ross bored out of her mind has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) Cherish the cabin. Not uh Take care of your sister. (Adding) Shes a paraplegic. But Cherish the cabin. (Smiling reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. Its often been a.. sanctuary for me. (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Supermans fortress of solitude. What? S uh Superman - he uh built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole to uh you know sort of get away from it all.. When I go Im passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan) (Drunk she laughs out loud) Ill take a hotel any day. Daddy.. Yes? Daddy about the cabin.. (Laughing she points to her shirt) Look Henry I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again) (To Susan) What about it? Well the thing is.. What? What is it? Well the - the cabin is kind of uh.. George? (Extremely blunt) Burned. Burned? There was a fire and it uh.. Burned. (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned? (Laughs) yeah burned. Whoo.. (Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her) Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything? (Solemn) No. Nothing. (Laughing shes obviously getting a kick out of her husbands misfortune) Nothing! Ha ha ha. Eh but you know Mr. Ross if - if you look at the whole situating what with it being your cigars and everything its really rather ironic - one might even say in a sense comical.. (Mr. Ross has by now left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George nodding laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it. (Offended) I cant believe you said that! What?! (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?! What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up! That was a weird thing to say. Why? It didnt mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldnt feel embarrassed. Ohh I think youre really sick. (Getting slightly offended) Im not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me. Im leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path) I really think youre making too much of this. (Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door) Let me walk you to a cab. (Opens the door) Thats ok. I mean the main thing is that this is just between us and thatll be the end of it. Oh really? (Quickly walks out) (Calling after her) I mean people - theyre not interested in things like this. They dont want to hear about it. They really dont. So were.. uhh drinkin and talkin and uhh so she starts rubbing my leg. Wo-hoah! What did you do? (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg? Yeah right. I mean I know its the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaines office. I know its wrong - but I cant get that hand off my leg. I mean Im looking at the hand and Im thinking That hand should not be on my leg. But I cant make my brain to get my mouth to say the words Would you mind?! Yeah woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that? I dont know theyre working on a whole other level.. Alright so go ahead. So we go back to my apartment.. (Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah! So were uh foolin around there.. you know its getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George to prevent others from hearing) and uh she starts with the dirty talking. (Putting his hands up) Alright alright hold on! (Jerry has Georges full attention) Time out! Woah woah! (Scooting in giddy) What did she say? (Modest) Oh you know the usual.. No I dont know. How do I know the usual? Typical things. (Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical. She says uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George so shocked by what hes just heard accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply) (Breathing deeply) Thats very dirty. (Jerry nods) Thats absolutely filthy. ..And then she starts talking about her panties. (Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here! So I said something. Ok what did you say? (Defensively) Now bear in mind I am just trying to keep up. Of course. Okay? So shes taking about her panties so uh.. So I said You mean the panties your mother laid out for you? (Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look he repeats it) The panties your mother laid out for you? (Jerry nods) What does that mean? (Throwing up his hands) I dont know! It just popped out. Well how did she react? She flipped out! Just left. Well thats not offensive. (Reflects) Its abnormal but its not offensive. Look the main thing is I dont want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean especially the panty remark. I mean its embarrassing. And shes never let me hear the end of it. She will tell her. Shes going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey so Susans father took that news pretty hard huh? Yeah yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing. I guess he failed to see the humor in it. Huh. (Makes a over his head gesture with his arm) Cmon lets go go. We got a lot of work to do today. (Getting up) Alright big work day. Thats right. Okay. Lets go. Here we are. Right now. Lets do it. You and me. Okay. Alright. Whatdya got? (Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter you go Hi and I go Hello. Now.. we need something here.. Oh hey. Dont be silly. Come in were taking a break. (Moving back into the room) Oh yeah? Yeah! Uh George did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars? (Scoffs) No I told you Im not gonna do that. (Concluding) Okay.. well I guess Im just going to have to take matters into my own hands huh? (Pause) Alright Ill see you guys. (Leaves despite No dont go! and other various comments by Jerry and George) Buenos dias. Buenos dias. Uh habla ingles? Si. Giddy-up. Ok uh (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone. What is this about? Uh well Its a very private matter but its extremely urgent. Are you an American? Oh yeah. I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone) Okay. (Stirring he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright lets get going. Cmon cmon now. (Approaches the intercom) Cmon lets get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah? Its Elaine. Cmon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine) (Standing up still waking up) Alright you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while.. (Agreeing) Yeah we should. Alright I just have to go over to the Ross apartment and drop off Susans sunglasses. Youll come with me? Yeah. Wha - what does she live with them? No no no no. Oh. Hey nice going Jerome Seinfeld! What? I just got a message from Sandra shes coming back to work. Well then youve just got to fire her! Dont even think about it - theres no two ways about it. Why? What happened? Did you talk? Talk? Did I talk? It - youre darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isnt anybody you should be talking to. Really? Yes. Really? You really think I should fire her? Oh yeah. Yeah in fact if George and I werent so busy here working on the script Id do it myself. (To secretary) Expira te afuera. (Standing up greeting the men) Buenos dias. What is your name Senor? Uh Kramer. So Senor Kramer what is this about? (Leaning in confidentially) Cigars. (Confused) Cigars? (Definite) Cigars. What about cigars? Uh see here I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings.. Ohh.. (Laughs pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these.. (Pointing at the cigar incredibly nervous) Yeah yeah. That- thats uh okay So uh Id like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you yeah? (Deeply sniffs the cigars aroma) You do realize of course these are illegal in your country. Um wha - oh illegal huh? I like that jacket.. Hi! Hi how are ya? (They kiss) Hey Jerry. Hi. I thought you two guys were working today. Ah just - takin a little break. (Chuckling) yeah. Uh oh heres your sunglasses. (Hands them to her) Ok thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother Ricky. Hes home from college for the weekend. Ohh hey there young fella. (They shake hands) Whats your major? (Blunt) I dont have one. Well you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) Theres nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George) (Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt Sara. (Staring at George) He doesnt look like me. Sara what do you have on your wheels? Nothing theyre clean. Ricky did you wipe her wheels off? (Annoyed) Yes. (Concluding) Well theyre filthy. Its just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels. Excuse me. (Answer the door. Its her doorman Raymond carrying a burnt box) Hello Raymond. Ah yes the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire. (Accepts the box) Oh thank you. (As the doorman leaves she turns to Jerry and George) Wow Ive never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh theyre letters. (Hands the box to George) Here. Oh sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters) From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever. Oh wow. (Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) Dear Henry last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyones attention) has left me a cripple. I dont how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin. (George nods and Jerry gives a Oh of course reaction) Well we.. we we ah.. (Looking at his watch ) Yeah.. We really should be uh heading out.. Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time. You know the time.. The box! (Rushes toward George grabbing the box away from him then the letters from Susans hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest defensively) Who told you to open this?! (Hysterical) Whos John?! Whos John?! (Yelling out) I knew it! I want to know who John is! John Cheever?! Dad you and John Cheever?! (Proclaiming) Yes! Yes he was the most wonderful person Ive ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go) Well we really should be- Yeah. Uh heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions. Yeah and (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time. yeah time is what hes indicating there..

So she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe! What calls?! Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe okay?! And weve been in touch and Sandra told Lippman!

(Smiling to himself) Beautiful. Why is that beautiful? Oh no not beautiful. Its four hundred and twenty nine dollars! Hey look Im going to pay for that. No no. (Taking out his checkbook) No I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my- (Giving up too easy) Okay. (Pauses noting Elaines quick accept) fault.

(Folding up the check) Ok Ill leave you two alone. (Moving back into the living room) Okay. (In the door way) Maybe Ill go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and theyre - all laid out for me. (Leaves smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other frozen in their places)]

There were old people there all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there they were just frozen!

Susans not going tonight you know. What do you mean not going? why not? I dont know she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.

What are you showing off to your girlfriend here is that it? Im not his girlfriend. We dated for a while but things didnt really work out. You people make me sick. That is one angry clown!

The guys a clown!. How do you even start into being a clown how do you know that you want to be a clown I guess you get to a point where youre pants look so bad its actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it a clown if there isnt a circus around them is really just a very annoying person. Youre in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen What youre picking somebody else up? Oh man! (Singing) Camera curtains lights - This is it well hit the heights - Oh what heights well hit - On with the show this is it!

49,4,10,[Were dead. Were not dead. We are dead. Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story. All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didnt do anything. So well do it tomorrow. Let me ask you something. Whens the last time you went skiing? About six years ago. I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now. Women like skiers. So what? You cant meet anybody. Youre going on with Susan. Yeah. Right. Hey see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. Shes in the closet business. The closet business? Whats the closet business? What is it your business? Im interested. She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet. So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her. Yeah. Yeah. So what happened? So she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi Marla. (Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry. George Marla. Marla. George. Jerry Stacey. Stacey. Jerry. George Stacey. Stacey. George. George. Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerrys cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey) So how was your trip to Berlin? Trip to Berlin? Remember? Thats why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while. Oh right right. The wall had just come down and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration. Yes yes I did. But you know I was watching it on CNN and they covered it so well I thought Why knock my brains out? You know my boyfriend went. Really? Yes I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go. Oh did he like it? I dont know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar) Anyway we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write. Wow what a great job. A writer. Not a bad way to make a buck. Sounds great. Well Ill tell you Stacey. Its a lot of hard work. But it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away) So are you gonna go out with her? I might. What about Susan? What? Im not married. Im not allowed to go out with somebody else? Depends. Depends on what? On many factors. Like what? Well how long youve been seeing her. Whats your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily? No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week. What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out or is a date implied? Implied. She got anything in your medicine cabinet? There might be some moisturizer. Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house? (Pause) Yeah. Well Ill tell you what youve got here. What? You got yourself a girlfriend. Ah no no. Are you sure? A girlfriend? Im looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out but... Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question What do you do? and I have a girlfriend. I mean you dont need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. Thats what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend you dont want a girlfriend you just want more girlfriends. Youre going to make a good father someday. Well its not fair Jerry. Its just not fair. All right all right. Thats it. Im getting out of this thing. Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means? No what? The script the pilot the TV show. Thats all over. Why? What do you mean? Figure it out. Shes one of the executives at NBC thats gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. Shes one of our biggest fans. You drop her off you think theyre gonna pick us up? Oh right. Oh no man. you know its a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls you lose the job. You see the irony? Yeah yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that shell still like me and it doesnt affect the deal. (sarcastically) Oh yeah. Wait wait. Here me out. Dont dismiss this. Youre very quick to dismiss. Dont dismiss. Shes got a big crush on David Letterman I mean a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman. This is your plan? No no. Im just thinking. I dont think you are. Let me tell you what I think. Please and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity. Are you very fussy about your pants? I dont think I am. Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it? Try me. Heres what Im proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers the bar the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. Well put everything on hooks. Everything? Everything. The shirts pants sport jackets pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here. Youre quite mad you know. (Kramer enters) Oh I dont believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey? Hey. What are you doing? Im watching The Bold and the Beautiful. No. What? This is not a good time. Five minutes. What? What did you have to give your TV away to George for? Because Ive been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldnt stop. It was it was destroying my brain cells. Yeah but now youre in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room) Well wow. Marla Kramer. Hey. Why dont you go out? Its nice out. Oh no. Theres nothing out there for me. Theres weather. Weather? I dont need weather. Weather doesnt do it for me. Im tellin George to give you your TV back. No no I dont want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight? I dont know. Will you tape it? Kramer... (points to Marla) Yeah. (He exits) So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin. Never came back. Oh you must have been devastated being left for a wall. It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem. Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah? Its me. Come on up. Oh its Elaine shes just a friend of mine. I dont know what shes doing here now. (Buzzer) Im sorry. What? I didnt get it. Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem. Well he wanted me to move in with him. Snapple? No thanks. Go on. Well I wouldnt move in because... Yes. Well because... Yeah. Well because Im a virgin. (Elaine enters) Hello! Hi um. Marla Elaine. Im sorry I didnt know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape. Oh thanks a lot two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana. Im sorry I really am. I just kept forgetting. I should be going. No no Im leaving. I like that thing in your hair there. Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. Youll appreciate this. Snapple? No thanks. I was talking to this guy you know and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze you know ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know its just lying there. So then this woman the one who sold me this hair thing she grabbed it before the guy noticed so. I mean big deal right? So I carry around my diaphragm who doesnt? Yeah like its a big big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when youre gonna need it right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh. I should be going. So well talk about the hooks then? Yes. (She exits) What? Was it something I said? Shes a virgin she just told me. Well I didnt know. Well its not like spotting a toupee. Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin? No no I mean... Cause Im not anti-virgin. Ill be right back. (She leaves) Elaine Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah? Its George. Shes a virgin? A virgin. Wow. So whatre you gonna do? I dont know. Im very attracted to her. That accent its so sexy. I dont think I could do it. You know they always remember the first time. I dont want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten. You need a little pioneer spirit. You know you dont have any of that Lewis and Clark in you. You know sometimes those guys dont make it back. (Looks in fridge) Im really hungry. Yeah me too. We gotta get something. I dont want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Lets get some Chinese. You wanna order it? All right but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer see if want anything. (Calls) Hey we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and Ill order for you. Im in. Lets go for it. What do you want? I dont care whatever. Ill tell you what. Why dont we just get a couple of dishes and well just share em. Okay. What are you getting? Im gonna get a Chow Fung. Whats a Chow Fung? Its a broad noodle. What do you mean a broad noodle? Its a big flat noodle. Well I dont want a big flat noodle. What kind of noodle do you want? Who says I want a noodle? All right look. Im getting the Chow Fung. You dont have to have any. All right. Ill get pea pods and you cant have any of my pea pods. Fine. Get extra MSG. Look Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now heres the one thing youve gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after its over. I mean something happens to their personality its really quite astounding. Its like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there. So they just leave? Yeah pretty much yeah. Well the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How you know they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly. Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that. Eh. All right lets go. We dont have much time before the meeting. Wheres the food? What happened to Ping? Dont worry hell be here. Look we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) Theres your food. Hey what about this? Im in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured you with me? Yeah. My cars totaled. Its all his fault and now he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler. Your butler? Right. He cooks my food he cleans my house he does all my shopping for me. And there you go thats your program. What about me? Dont worry well find something for you. (Knock of Jerrys door) (Getting the door) Thats the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine Marla and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping what happened? There was a bit of an accident. Head hurts. Head really hurts. What happened? Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying. Something happened to the food? I only saved one bag. Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor? Ill get some ice. (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters) Hey you got the food? Yeah here. What took you so long? Hey Ping! Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch) Yeah. Wheres yours? He dropped it. Oh thats too bad. You should slow down you know that? Its dangerous to go that fast. No no. I have green light. You jaywalked. (To Jerry) Hey you watchin Oprah? (To Ping) I did not jaywalk. (To George) Youre givin him back that TV. (To Elaine) Yes you jaywalked. (To Jerry) No I dont want it back. (To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you. (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting? (To himself) Hey look. An hour with Patrick Swayze. A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I cant believe we put it off until today and then we couldnt do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin crosses against a light and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now were gonna make fools of ourselves we got nothing. Youre not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. Ive been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? Its like that (Snaps in Georges face)  like that! One bad impression youre outta the business! All right lets postpone it. Lets get out of here. What do you mean? They know were here. Ill fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I cant believe my back. No no would you get up? I can do this Jerry. No. All right Ill tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! Thats the kind of sick city that were livin in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family. What? Thats David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. Ill be right back. (He exits) Mr. Seinfeld theyre ready for you. (She exits) Yes I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting) Hi how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello. Hello Jerry. Im Rita Kearson. Oh uh nice to meet you. Wheres Russell? He uh had to go to LA. Theres a problem on the set of Blossom. Oh poor Blossom. (He sits) Anyway he asked me to sit in for him. Oh he ran to say something to David Letterman. David Lettermans on the floor? Yeah he just walked by. Well I think we should get started anyway. Yeah good idea. So how are you guys comin along? Good good weve got a lot of ideas. Good. (Pause) Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you itll be like five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin there for like thirty minutes? Well we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all youre doin is waitin for the table. (They dont seem to like it) Because weve all been in that situation. You know youre waiting... and youre hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back? So thats the idea? Well no thats one. We have many others. We have an idea where uh I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me he has to cook for me... He cleans my house hes doin my shopping you know? Im walkin around with one of those big neck collars. You tellin em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey sorry Im late. (Looks at Rita) Russell? Im Rita Kearson. Oh Rita. Hey Mr. Shermack howre you doing good to see you. Jay always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah yeah that butler idea thats beautiful. Isnt that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler. Dont worry uh well find something for you. So Letterman didnt spark to your idea huh? No he said there was nothing he could do and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half. You you guys wanna hold it down? Im watchin Jeopardy. Would you give him the TV back? Oh by the way George. Susan called for you a minute ago. I bet theyre probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan) (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up! Hello? Hi its me. Its Georgie Boy. Whats going on? Whats going on? Whats going on? Ill tell you whats going on. Im fired! Fired? Why? Because you kissed me. You kissed me you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone. (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again. But I had no... I didnt realize. You didnt realize? How could you not realize? Youre stupid!

He fired her! This is incredible he fired her. Im out baby! Im out! Why did he fire her? Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out he fired her over the phone. Finally my stupidity pays off! What is here comes the judge here comes the judge! You cant break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her. What? You gotta at least wait until she gets another job. Another job? Couple of interviews. Oh this is unbelievable. Im stuck. Every time I think Im out they pull me back in. Are you gonna leave after its over? You know if we have sex. What? Leave? Where? Why? You know the apartment. Why would I leave? This is my apartment. Well what if it was my apartment? Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave? Well Elaine said men like to leave after its over. Listen I wouldnt put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully but her house was in bad shape. Maybe I should get going. What else did you say to her? Nothin. I was just givin her the straight dope. More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you shell wind up in a convent. Listen there was a lot more I couldve told her believe me. What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you? You mightve if Id stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her. I was trying to be. Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out huh? Oh youre not kiddin. Whod ve figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going. Yeah since she met him shes been vomited on her family cabins been burned down she learned her fathers a homosexual and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah they had a real good thing going. What do I do? Well actually Im a writer. In fact Im writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now. A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol this guys writing a sitcom. A sitcom? Come on lets go. (They leave) A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!]
50,4,11,[(To Elaine) Let me ask you a question. nan Mm-hm. nan Youre a hostage captured by terrorists- (Smiling chewing) Who me? nan You anybody - whatever. Youre in the little room youre chained to the floor youre there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry? nan (Matter-of-factly) They have to its in the Geneva Convention. nan (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks your pants your underwear. Were doing the wash. Cmon! Take it off take it off! nan Hey Georgie. nan Hi. nan (To George) Whats the matter? nan (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me. nan Caught you? Doing what? nan You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone.. nan (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?! nan (Nods) Uh-huh. nan (Laughing) She caught you? nan Where? nan (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - theyre supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine I started leafing through it.. nan Glamour? nan ..So one thing lead to another.. nan So what did she do? nan First she screams George what are you doing?! My God! And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall trying to hang onto it. nan (Reflecting on the story so far) Man.. nan I didnt know whether to try and keep her from falling or zip up. nan What did you do? nan I zipped up! nan (Wide-eyed) So she fell? nan Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid he gets defensive) Well I couldnt run over there the way I was! nan No I guess you couldnt have.. nan (In the middle of Elaines sentence smiling) No I wouldnt think so. nan (Finishing it off) ..done that. nan So she fell and then she started screaming My back! My back! So I picked her up and took her to the hospital. nan (Between chuckles) How is she? nan (Somewhat angered) Shes in traction. nan (Still laughing) Ok Im sorry. nan Its not funny Elaine. nan (Stifling her laughter) I know. Im sorry. Im serious. nan Her back went out. Shes gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was Why George why?!.. I said Because its there! Glamour? nan (Vowing) Well Ill tell you this though - I am never doing.. that  again. nan What you mean in your mothers house or all together? nan (Definite) All together. nan Oh gimme a break.. nan (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right. nan Oh like youre gonna stop? nan Cmon.. nan You dont think I can? nan No chance. nan (Daring) You think you could? nan Well I know I could hold out longer than you. nan Care to make it interesting? nan Sure how much? nan A hundred dollars. nan (Pointing) Youre on. nan (Butting in) Wait a second wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue) You? nan Yeah. nan Youll be out before we get the check. nan (Smiling) I want to be in on this too. nan (Rejecting) Ohh no. No no no.. nan Why? nan (Showing difference) Its apples and oranges.. nan What? Why? (More no no nos from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why? nan Because youre a woman! nan So what? nan Its easier for a woman not to do it than a man. nan (Sarcastic) Oh. nan We have to do it. Its part of our lifestyle. Its like uh.. shaving. nan Oh that is such bologna. I shave my legs. nan (Making a point) Not everyday. nan Alright look you want to be in? nan Yeah! nan You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars. nan No a thousand! nan No Ill - Ill put up one-fifty. nan Alright youre in for one-fifty. nan (Nodding) Okay one-fifty. nan Alright now how are we gonna monitor this thing? nan Well obviously we all know each other very well (Elaine slightly laughs) Im sure that well all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. nan Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table) (Stern) No ma Im not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I dont care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah alright Ill see you later. Yes of course Im gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs shaking his head) You know if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing he snorts) (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah? nan (Defensively) Whatever. nan How is she? nan (Shrugging it off) Shell be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight. nan (Answering to the intercom) Yeah? nan Its me. nan Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door) Hey what are you doing tonight? nan (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla. nan Oh the virgin? nan Yeah. nan Any uh.. progress there? Whats the latest? nan Well I got my troops amassed along the border - Im just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead. nan Hey look at this cmere. Theres a naked woman across the street. nan Where? nan Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left? nan (In awe) Wow! nan (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?! nan (Suggesting) Maybe shes a nudist. You know those nudist colony people.. nan ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up and walks out Jerrys apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view he shuts the door behind him) Hey let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies do they eat naked in the dining room? nan I would imagine its all naked. nan What about the chamber maids? Are they naked too? nan (Still focused on the nudist) Theyre naked the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama. nan Hey. nan (Only turning back for a second) Hey. nan Well (Smiling) wheres my money? Who caved? nan (Over his shoulder) Not me. nan (Also over his shoulder) Not me. nan Whatre you looking at? nan Theres a naked woman across the street. nan (Smiling chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money Ive ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So my fried Joyce is teaching an aerobics class. Im gonna go tonight. nan (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress shouldve taken it back. nan (Realizes Jerry and George arent paying attention) So then I got a call this morning. You know I was uh chosen to go on the space shuttle. Were goin to Mars. nan (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh. nan Have a good time. nan (Declaring) Im out! nan What?! nan Yeah Im out - Im out of the contest. nan Youre out?! nan Yeah yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what? nan Well that was fast! nan Well it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know you better be careful buddy. Shes gonna get you next. (Walks out shutting the door behind him) ..And then there were three. nan I dont understand you. I really dont. You have nothing better to do at three o clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk I come home and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park! nan (Stern trying to shut her up) Ma. nan Dont give me Ma. Its a good thing I didnt hit the table. I could of cracked my head open. nan Ma people can hear you. nan (Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you cant do that for a living. Youd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star! nan (Getting up) Alright Ma thats enough! nan I want you to go see a psychiatrist. nan No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist! nan Why? Why not?! Why wont you go? nan (Like a kid) Because I dont want to. nan I want you to go see somebody. nan Well I am not going. nan Its a good thing your fathers in Chicago. nan Hello Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen? nan (Snapping) Is that important really? What is this a police investigation? The womans been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?! nan Hi Denise. Six-thirty time for your sponge bath. nan Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep. nan (Seems not to notice whats going on beyond the divider) So George what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television writing - thing? nan (Slowly backing away hes not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television. nan Let me help you out with that. Here just slip it over your head.. nan Oh.. thank you. nan (Nodding) Well its about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on George is now completely mesmerized) What is it youre doing exactly? nan George youre cousin Shelly is talking to you! nan So when was the last time you took a class? nan Oh its been a while. nan (Overly excited) Are you psyched? nan (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah Im really.. psyched. nan Well youre gonna thank me for getting you in here. nan Why is that? nan (Pointing she directs Elaines attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts? nan (Between breaths) Oh my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Juniors here! nan Hes gonna be in your class today. nan (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedys gonna be in my class?! nan I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt. nan Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-Johns butt. nan Lets slow it down a little. nan Slow it down? nan Well (Reminding him of her virginity) You know.. nan Ah yeah.. I know. nan Youre okay with that right? nan Yeah yeah.. of course. What do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesnt mean anything to me. (Faint) I dont care about that. nan So Ill see you Saturday night then? nan (Smiling nodding) Sure Saturday night. nan Alright then. Good night. nan Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door he waves) (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng! nan (Out of it) Yeah good morning. nan Ha ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerrys window) Shes not there. Shes doin her wash. nan (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So did you make it through the night? nan (Over the top) Yes Im proud to say I did! nan So youre still master of your domain. nan (Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment and Im tellin her to put those shades down! nan Woah woah woah. What-what did you just say? nan I cant take it anymore! Shes driving me crazy! I cant sleep I cant leave the house and I here Im climbin the walls. Meanwhile Im dating a virgin Im in this contest - somethings gotta give! nan Do you hear what youre saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked and you want to tell her to stop?! Thats the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean think comprehens- Im not gonna let you do it. nan (Persistent) Well Im doin it get out of my way. nan (Stopping him) No no no no. You cant! You cant! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys looking through our bedroom windows we would think: Why cant there be a woman out there taking her clothes off? And now that wishs come true and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?! nan Look Im sorry- No Im not gonna let you do it Jerry. nan Kramer (Trying to pass him) get outta my way! nan (Frantic) No no no. Dont do it. Dont do it! For my sake! God knows I dont ask you for much! (Pleading) Now come on. Please Jerry. Please! Im beggin ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please! nan Alright.. (Takes his coat off) Yes! nan ..Alright. nan (Moving to the window) Thank you thank you thank you. (Sits in Jerrys chair looking out the window) Shes not there! nan Oh I can wait.. nan So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath? nan Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs then snorts) I was going nuts. nan Oh man. Well I guess youll be going back to that hospital. nan (Fake sympathy) Well my mother Jerry.. nan (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain? nan (Arms out) I am king of the county. You? nan Lord of the manor. nan John F. Kennedy Jun-ya! nan What? nan (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class. nan Really? Did you talk to him? nan No you dont understand - he was working out right in front of me. So listen after the class was over I timed my walk to the door so wed get there at the exact same moment and he says to me (Thinking the world of what he said) Quite a workout. Quite a workout? What did you say? nan (Smiling proud) I said yeah. (Adding fake praise) Good one. nan So then listen listen. So then I showered and I dressed and I saw him again on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So were walkin and talkin and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but I mean who the hell knows.. And so then he says to me: Do you wanna split a cab uptown? And I said Sure - even though I was going downtown. So we get in the cab and I mean I have no idea where Im goin right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior were talkin about! (Deep breath) So then he says to me Where do you live? And I - and I - and I was close to your block so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh God.. nan But the question is are you still master of your domain? nan (Sets the glass down) Im queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth) Youre back. nan Of course Im back. Why wouldnt I be back? My mothers in the hospital Im going to pay her a visit. nan I know but two days in a row? You didnt have to do this. nan Youre my mother! What wouldnt I do for you? nan You know what you could do? I havent eaten lunch or dinner. I cant eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich.. nan (Smiling) You got it Ma. (She smiles back nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair looking at the divider in anticipation) (Let down) Could you go now George? Im very hungry. Im weak. nan Well wait a little while Ma. Whats the difference? nan I dont understand why you cant do this for me! nan (Standing up) I just got here Ma! Id like to spend a little time with you. nan But if you wait they wont let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over! nan Ten minutes! Here here (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs. nan Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) Im sorry you came. nan (To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath. nan George.. Im huuunnnggry! nan (Muttering slow) Hang on Ma.. hang on.. nan Hi! nan Hi. nan Did you get your hair done today? nan No I just uh fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around she quickly checks her breath) You know who - isnt here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday. nan (Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression? nan Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away) No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?! nan (Uneasy) He asked about you. nan (Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter both feet in the air) What did he say? nan He wanted to know your situation. nan (Quick) What situation? I have a situation? nan I-I told him you were single. nan That was good. That was very good. nan He said you were just his type. nan (Frank) Okay you tryin to hurt me? Are you tryin to hurt - youre tryin to injure me right? Youre trying to hurt me. nan He also told me to tell you that hell be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o clock - so hes gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello. nan Alright Ma Ill talk to you later.. Nothing Im Im watching uh Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon.. Its I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent wholesome quality. Okay alright Ill talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up) (Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh thats good. Thats good. Thats very very good. Oh its hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) Its hot in there. So just walk around a little bit. Dont be ashamed dont be ashamed.. thats good thats good.. yes yes yes.. nan (Trying to block out Kramer he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round round and round round and round. The wheels on the bus.. nan The woman across the street has nothing on nothing on nothing on.. nan All you got is instant coffee? Why dont you get some real coffee? nan I dont keep real coffee in here I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?! nan (Through intercom) Its Elaine. nan (Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine) Where did you get those socks? nan I dont know. nan I think those are my socks! nan How are these your socks?! nan I dont know but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe and now I dont have them anymore! nan (Sarcastic) Oh yeah thats right well you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin feet. They looked so good to me I just had to have them! nan Yeah well theyre my socks! nan Theyre my socks! nan Oh boy.. nan What are we doing here.. nan ..Oh boy. nan This is ridiculous. nan Do you believe this? Were fighting. Were fighting. nan I havent been myself lately. Ive been snapping at everybody. nan Me too. Ive been yelling at strangers on the street. nan Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse and starts to count it up) (Shocked) You caved?! nan Its over? nan Youre out? nan Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead. nan I figured youd cruise. At least through the Spring. nan What happened? nan It was..uh.. John-John. nan Ohhhhh.. John-John. nan But you made it through the day before. nan Yeah but yesterday he told Joyce the aerobics teacher that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o clock tonight. nan Why outside here? nan Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab and he dropped me off out in front? Hes picking me up. nan Alright Costanza - its just you and me. nan And then (Smacks the money) there were two. nan (Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior.. nan Lets go in the bedroom. nan Really? nan Yes. nan You sure? nan Yes. nan You really want to? nan I do. Im ready. nan Okay.. nan I know how difficult this must have been for you. nan (Chuckles) You dont know the half of it. nan What do you mean? nan Well its kinda silly but.. nan Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends? nan No it was just a bet. I mean it actually started with George and his mother- I dont want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind. nan Marla? Hi oh Im glad I ran into you- I dont want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused Elaine moves closer) Ooohh get away from me! Youre horrible. nan What happened? nan I told her about the contest. nan Ohh. Boy shes a whack-o. nan (To Elaine) Hey what happened? nan What? nan I thought you were meeting Kennedy. nan (Let down) He didnt show. nan Yeah he did. nan What? Hes - Hes out there? Oh my God. I-I gotta go I gotta go.. nan No no no. He just left. nan What? nan Yeah he was talking to Marla. nan Marla? nan Yeah I think you know she was like crying and he was consoling her and then she uh just got into his car and they just drove away. nan (Angered) He left with Marla the virgin? nan Yeah. nan They drove away? nan Yeah drove away.. You know I said Hello to him. You know hes - hes- (Moving to the window shocked) Oh my God in heaven! nan (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..? nan Kramer?! nan Hes waving.. nan Ohh John. That was wonderful.. nan]
51,4,12,[Bah bah baaah Boo doo bah bah bah boo doo waaaah waah waaaah... Hey could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up? Hey guess what? This window doesnt work. I hate rental cars. Nothin ever works: the window doesnt work the radio doesnt work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you? Gimme ten bucks and find out... So this worked out pretty good. Them givin me an extra ticket yknow you get a free trip to St. Louis I did my gig you got to see your sister... Yeah worked out good. And heres the beauty-- What? George is pickin us up at the airport. Get out of here! Why? You know that awning outside my building? Yeah... Hes always bragging about his vertical leap so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldnt touch the awning. So what happened? He didnt come within two feet of the thing. Hes wavin at it... So I told him if he picks us up at the airport he wouldnt have to pay me anything. Hey how we doin on time? Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car pick up the rental car shuttle we walk right on the plane... Hey! Wait up! Hey! Wait up! Sorry. Heh heh heh... Where you goin? Uh JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything? Yeah you want five? Gimme ten. Youre giving him *ten* dollars? Well we got three bags. Thats a pretty big tip... Thats what they get! They dont get that much. Lets ask him. We cant ask him... Lets see what he says. Jerry we dont have time for this... Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me my friend and I here we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip. Depends on the person depends on the bag. Uh how about a couple of people like us. People like you? I wouldnt expect much you dont even look like you know what youre doing... Cmon seriously... Well since you asked usually I get five dollars a bag. What!? Thats right. *Five* dollars a bag? I dont think so. Look you asked I told you. You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us... All right look were late. Thank you very much... Youre lucky I dont report you... JFK... ...Honolulu. Wait up! You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane youve gotta run like a man! Get your knees up! The flights been canceled?!?! Everything into JFKs booked... No wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but theyre not together. Its boarding right now. Well take em! Were not going to sit together? Well so what? Its not that long-- youll read. Well what about George? Hes supposed to pick us up at Kennedy. Well call him... Theres no time. No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time? Theres no time.

Bon voyage Lainey! Great... [To herself] Help me... Excuse me I think youre in my seat... Oh sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*! Hey thanks for coming with me. Hey what made you think you could touch that awning? I confused it with another awning. So how we doin on time? Were perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you its a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) Whats going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission! Will you relax?! Oh I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing! This is the best way to go! Do you know what happens if I miss him? I dont get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks... George theres no traffic at this time. Now come on man... Really? If anything well probably get there early. Ill have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop. The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is? Duty. Yeah duty. Do you know how much duty is? No I dunno how much duty is. Duty is *nothing*. Its like sales tax... I still like to stop at the duty free shop. I like to stop at the duty free shop. I like to stop at the duty free shop! So he says ``squeeze your breasts together and I say ``I thought this was an ad for shoes... Oh my... Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146. Wow! Coming out of the shower... Its a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for? See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background out of focus? Uh-huh... How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] Well get there... Oh look at this... Hes sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe hell wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what Im doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her but still to herself] Yeah make a little more noise with your gum-- thats helpful. Theyre not here! You cost me fifty bucks! Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees! Look were wasting our time here! Were a half-hour late theyve probably took it off the board already. No there it is right there-- 133... and its canceled. Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here! Ok cmon... lets go check over at the ticket counter. Oh there it is honey gate 18A 8:30... [He leaves] Did you see that guy? No... What guy? That guy.. He was just... Listen you go over to the ticket counter Im going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. Theres supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name! [still lost] I know that guy... Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.

Maybe Ill read it tomorrow-- in the park! Its supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence that is! Theyre on a different flight. Theyre scheduled to land in a half hour only at Laguardia. Laguardia? All right lets go. Cmon... Where do I know that guy from? [To herself loudly] Wake up you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I cant hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me Ive gotta go to the bathroom... Oh my... that *is* refreshing... Would you care for some slippers? Sounds lovely! [To Tia motioning to put them on her] May I? Please! Why Its a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella. My name is not mentioned in this blurb... Its Grossbard! Whos Grossbard? When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well I try to find him I went to his girlfriends house even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And thats the guy-- John Grossbard! Hey Kramer cmon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago... No Im gonna turn around... Im gonna get that guy... No-no-no Kramer. Kramer! Kramer!

Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam. Oh volunteer work!. See thats what I like about the holiday season. Thats the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didnt have to go to all that trouble. It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing. I didnt even see the picture. How did it come out? Well you know. Its a picture? Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job. Yeah well. How hard is it to take a picture? ... um ... What? Did you look at look at this picture carefully? Carefully? Because Im not sure and and and correct me if Im wrong but I think I see ... a nipple. What? Here. Take a look. What what is that? (gasps) Oh my God! Thats my nipple. Thats what I thought. Thats my nipple. My nipples exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh Nana and Papa. DIDNT YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE? Oh God I didnt notice. Oh what am I going to do?

Dont you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch? Yeah? (OC) Its me. Come on up. Was there any nostril penetration? There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call. So lets say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay so then what? Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick? I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me youre not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would would you do?

I thought you said it was a scratch. But thats not what she thinks. Why dont you call her agency. Maybe shes been out of town and she didnt get the calls. All right. Ill call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes Im trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if shes been in town? Shes been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. Shes at CALVIN KLEINs right now. Lets go. Itll be different this time. I need someone a little more stable. Im not stable? Im like a rock. I take these glasses off you cant tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most peoples minds? Costanza! People dont change. I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now Im dunkin a piece of toast in there and Im loving it. Im not a soft boiled egg. And I am not a piece of toast. I just dont think we have anything in common. Thats okay. Thats good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows you know with the milk examining the milk delving into milk consummed with milk. Pasteurization Homogenization She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand. Why were there so many cockroaches? Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house.

Well I had to talk to you - I noticed you havent been returning my calls. Well Ive been busy. Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night an the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered he indicates a nose pick) (Waving him off) Id rather not talk about this.. But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril. I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators) But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick! I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry) No! No pick! All right now heres the scoop Jockey. I uh I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.. (Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face.. Yeah.. And um when I told him my idea about the beach cologne you know he - he laughed at me. Youre very lithe arent you? Very graceful. Well yeah. Sit down eh? (Kramer misjudging one side of the couch sits down uncomfortably) Youre very lean but muscular.. You know I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah just recently I cut out fructose. Youre spectacular. (Flattered) Oh? I told you Fred - my friends next door neighbor took it. (Incredulous) Soo - what happened?! Well I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it. I really dont see how you could miss a button like that. Oh youve never missed a button?! (Phone rings she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?.. Your sister Gail. Oh God - my nephew.

Take it!.. An stop calling me Nip! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. its gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress. About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. Whats your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. Hes wearing only dress shoes socks and his briefs) My.. hes sexual athletic.. an without a trace of self-consciousness! His buttocks are sublime! Of course his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room. (Mesmerized with Kramers body) No lets get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately. Youve done it again C.K.! An what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing and never will. What does that make me? And Im not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there whove been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an every one of them who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerrys still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal! I did not bare myself deliberately but I tell you I wish now that I had! (Fred shocked by her speech flees. She calls after him still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul! So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So were in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. Im cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick. The pick? The pick? She comes out of the bathroom Im in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face. I think Ive seen that look. Ive got the magazine. The underwear ad came out. Boy they really worked on your pectorals. Your buttocks are spectacular. Oh my!

Alright well if you change your mind well wind up as Isabellas probably around seven. No no Isabellas I dont want to go to Isabellas. Why? No its too trendy no Isabellas.

Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open. What? This is not good. This is not good. Whats the matter? I just dont think its such a great idea for you to sit here. Why not? He thinks that if youre too funny he might not look so funny. Biff? What? Youre not worried about that? No of course not. I mean so what if Im funny? Who cares? He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show shell walk out on his show go see the other show. Well should we leave? Maybe you dont have to be so funny. I mean would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? Thats all Im asking. This woman thinks Im very funny. Now youre gonna be funny so what am I gonna be?

(To Elaine) and it wouldnt kill you to not be so funny either. What? What did I do? Hi. (subdued almost somber) Hello. Welcome back. Sorry it was my aunts birthday and she makes such a big deal about it. Well nobody likes to get old right? Well birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little weve grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge with each flicker of the candles on the cake we know its not to be that for the rest of our sad wretched pathetic lives this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing. Funny guy huh? Here take it. I was glad to get rid of it. Well thank you very much its about time. Oh listen guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me. Drop the case? Well congratulations thatll save you some money. Yeah no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune. (leafing through his mail) Oh great a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris. Hear that? Guess whos back. (Opening the door) Hey! Hey. I thought you werent coming back till Monday. Well the camp ended a few days early. Why? Uh well there was an incident. What happened? I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth. What? Yeah I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week. You punched who in the mouth? Mickey Mantle. What happened? Well you know we were playing a game and you know I was pitching and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone he was up and man that guy you know he was crowding the plate. Wow! Joe Pepitone! Yeah well Joe Pepitone or not I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one you know inside you know a little chin music put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when Im on the mound. Well the next pitch hes right back in the same place. So I had to plunk him. You plunked him. Oh yeah. Well he throws down his bat he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing both benches are cleared you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp you know and the old Yankee players and as Im trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates you know somebody pulls me from behind you know and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down and woah man its Mickey. I punched his lights out. Wow this is incredible! Leave me alone! You cant do this to me! Whats going on out there? What are you doing? This is not right people. Youre making a very bad mistake very bad. Babu? (leaving) Ill be right back. (to Kramer) Yeah so? Then Hank Bauer you know hes screaming Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey! So whatd you do? Well I got the hell out of there. They took Babu away?! Yeah the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment he had a job. What a shame. I will Babu! I will help you Babu dont worry! Then Hank Bauer you know hes chasing me around he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer. (thumbing through his mail) Uh oh. What? Well this is interesting. What is it? Its a letter from the Immigration Bureau its Babus Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake. Well doesnt he need that? If you had given me my mail last week when I got home this whole thing never would have happened. Well you should have come to my house to pick it up. Yeah so am I being funny now? No actually youre not being funny now. See I told you I wasnt funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George look Im not funny now. No and you werent funny last night either. In fact you got us both so depressed she asked me to drive her home after dinner. Oh look I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer his Visas expired. What do you need her for? Theres a million lawyers. Yeah but you said this is one of the things that her firm does. Alright alright but no funny business same deal as last night. Ah will you stop it already? Jerry please? How long is this gonna go on? Till Im comfortable. Well when is that gonna be? After consummation. Consummation? I dont think you have enough material. I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. Youre very lucky. (somber) Thats wonderful news. Thank you. Youre a very serious person arent you? Well with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy it doesnt seem like it would be fair to be cheerful. I understand. I think its curdled. I dont care. Do you ever laugh? Not really. Sometimes when Im in the tub. Thats so sad. What do you do? Im a comedian. Oh let me get that. (reaching for the check) Youve been so helpful. (entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey were gonna go see Babu now right? Yeah Ill just pay for this. Oh Im just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi. Hi. Listen gosh I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case. Well after we met you were all so nice. I just couldnt go through with it. But between you and me you would have paid through the nose. Babu! Jerry! Jerry hello Jerry! You remember Elaine. Yes yes of course! Nice to meet you. So nice of you both to come. Oh Babu. No no youre both very kind very kind. We try. We do what we can. We do what we can. The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it. Yes well see heres the thing Babu. Um what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows. Comedy shows! Youre a very funny man. Well Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away because you know that little box can get very full. Oh yes of course. TV Guide magazines everything. You know I would have picked up your mail your box is right next to mine. Oh I dont want to bother you. No bother! You get me job you get me apartment you very very good man. So yesterday after they took you away I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box. Come again? You see Ive been home for a week and Elaine didnt give me my mail until yesterday even though I asked her repeatedly for it. Yeah but Babu he could have come to my house to pick it up. You had my Visa application?! Well not technically. (extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!! Well what about her? I kill both of you!! Babu?! No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man! Babu Im gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department theyre gonna straighten the whole thing out the wheels are in motion things are happening even as we speak! The wheels are in motion? The wheels are in motion things are happening! Jerry? Im very attracted to him. You think the person you were talking to is him? Thats not even close to him. Hes funny Jerrys funny. He never said anything funny. He cant not be funny. No no no hes dark. And disturbed. Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. Thats how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed thats disturbed. You cant find sickness like that anywhere you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me nobody. Hes pretending Im the genuine article. So youre telling me Jerrys whole thing was an act? Yes! And I put him up to it because Im sick! Im the one that needs help. I gotta go. Well should I call you later? Please dont. But but Im disturbed! Im depressed! Im inadequate! I got it all!! So whats up with Babu? How come hes not back? I dont know I dont understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care Its George. Cmon up. Babu must be back. Babu my goodness what has happened to you? Wheres Babu? He is in Pakistan! Who are you? I am his brother. He knew a lawyer it was all going to be fixed. Im sure the lawyer did everything they could. Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu! (offering a drink) Snapple? No too fruity. Hey what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa. She didnt help him? No. Where is he? Hes in Pakistan. Oh boy. What do you mean oh boy? Well last night she told me that she liked you. Not you the disturbed you so I had to tell her the truth. Told her the truth? Well you got Babu deported. What do you mean I got? You didnt give him his Visa application. Thats because she had my mail. Yeah well I wouldnt have had to get your mail if he hadnt gone to that fantasy camp. Well I just came back from Mickey Mantles restaurant. How could you go in there? Well I had to. I had to apologize. I mean I punched Mickey Mantle my idol. It was eating me up inside! Well what happened? I got down in my knees and went Go ahead Mickey. Hit me. Im begging you Mickey please hit me. Cmon hit me. I love you Mickey I love you! So what did he do? Well the four of them they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside right into a horse. Kramer? Yeah? Its my Chinese food. Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me. Not anymore. What? Cheryl call me last night lawsuit back on. Why? She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. Shes a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista baby. So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help he said the wheels were in motion but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here. This is a terrible story Babu. What are you going to do? Im going to save up every rupee. Someday I will get back to America and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.]
55,4,16,[Wait a second wait a second...and then the butler says Im not cleanin it up! Im sick of cleaning! Thats funny thats funny! Im sick of cleaning. Thats very funny. Ill tell you something Ive never seen a pilot script as funny as this! Yeah its funny! I mean how funny is this? Its funny. I mean were not stupid right? We know when somethings funny! It cannot not be funny! Now come on lets stay with it we gotta finish this today. Okay. Hey you know what maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. Shes smart I trust her. Yeah maybe Ill give it to Elaine. Hey you know we havent brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm We should try and get her into this scene. Right right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters. Right (Thinks) What does she say...? I dont know what do women say? I dont know. I dont even know what they think. Thats why Im in therapy. You know if we bring Elaine in its going to be so many people to keep track of. Its gonna be too hard Ill forget where everybodys standing you me Kramer the butler its too much. Alright forget Elaine. Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.) Hey. Hey. Hey. You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today. Who? Your old flame. Gail Cunningham. Did you talk to her? Well I was on my way to the Y and I saw her coming towards me? I didnt know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldnt kiss you goodnight. So now Im thinking you know what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean what is my responsibility here? So what happened? Yeah yeah so she sees me and she goes (imitates Gail) Oh hi! Kramer! You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight. Yeah I know about the three dates. You know what I did? I snubbed her. What do you mean you snubbed her? I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word. Right by her? Right by her! What you do say about a guy like this huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend I tell ya snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. Ive never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question. Yeah. Well you know she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse. Im not even in here! Yeah I know. Well I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes. Well there were too many people in the room we couldnt keep track of everybody. George and the butler and... You couldnt keep track of everybody? Well we tried. We couldnt. We didnt know how to uh...(confessing) ...we couldnt write for a woman. We didnt know what you would say. Even right now Im sitting here I know youre going to say something I have no idea what it is. You have no idea? Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.) I thought Id find you here. Well Gail Cunningham. Hi Gail. Hi Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey what is with your friend Kramer? Why? He snubbed me. Are you sure? Yeah Im sure. What did you tell him? Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerrys sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey where you goin with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.) I thought you were finished. I took two bites how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus youre coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite? So how come? Why did Kramer do that? I dont know. Once he leaves the building hes out of my jurisdiction. Well tell him that I am mad at him. Alright. So where ya cookin now? Pfeiffers. Ah the power lunch crowd. Nice shoes! Oh. Thank you. Whered you get em? Theyre um Botticellis. Ooh Botticellis! Look at you! Im afraid to go in there. Really. Would you care to join us? No no I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.) See ya. Oh look at you the Botticellis. That bothered you? Yes it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticellis Im not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me. It did? Yes! Couldnt you see that? No. This is why youre not in the pilot. Well George I think youre beginning to get some perspective on things. I think were making progress. Yeah I feel like Ive grown. Good. So lets pick up on this next week. Great. (They both stand.) Oh by the way did you get a chance to read the script? Yes yes I did. Well whatd you think? Uh...it was...good. You didnt like it? Well no I - I cant believe this! What was wrong with it? What didnt you like about it? It wasnt funny. It wasnt funny? What are you kidding? No I didnt find it funny. You didnt find it funny?! This is what Im paying for? Well that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident doesnt have any insurance so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didnt really buy that. Let me tell you who did uh buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple the president of NBC and he ate it up with a spoon. George if youre going to be in a creative field youre going to have to learn how to deal with criticism. Hows this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know whats funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of com-med-dee! You sitting here telling people what to do. I think youd better go. Oh Im goin baby. Im goin. (Heads for the door then stops.) Its Jerrys fault. He took out all my good lines. Hes such a control freak! So you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that? I guess she didnt think it was funny. Oh she didnt think it was funny. What is she Rowan & Martin? Were supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And Im paying for this shes my employee! I thought your mothers paying for it. And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday I might be able to walk up to a woman and say Yes Im bald but Im still a good person. You know hes right. Its not her place to criticize the script which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me. What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.) Hey buddy I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerrys question.) Hey one second you dont get off that easy. Cmon tell me what you thought. Well you know I... I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.) You what? Yeah I kissed her. You kissed her? Right on the mouth. What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing? Well I saw her outside the Y you know she came up to me she started yelling because I snubbed her and then we started talking a little bit and I walked her to her building. And just before I left I put my arm around her waist I pulled her to me and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.) And what did she do? She kissed me back. I dont get this. I go out with this girl three times she doesnt want to shake my hand - whys she kissing you? Because I snubbed her. You see? Women they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good they love the snub! No they dont. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.) Ooh so...I understand youre buying your shoes now at Botticellis. What? Who told you that? Gail Cunningham. I dont understand why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation? Well you know we were just talking and uh she mentioned how youre buying your shoes now at Botticellis. How Im buying my shoes now at Botticellis! Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.) So what? So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobodys business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen comically puzzled by her outburst...) Hey! Gail! Ya. (noticing its Elaine) Elaine...! Why are you talking about my shoes? What? My Botticelli shoes. Youve been talking about my Botticelli shoes. What are you talking about? Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticellis? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gails cutting board.) Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera? Look Elaine I am very busy here. Who else have you mentioned my shoes to huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation! I am not discussing this. This is insane. You got that pasta primavera? Lets go! Ya ya ya here. Here you are Mr. Dalrymple. Thank you. Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch. Well come in. (They shake hands.) Hi. Awfully sorry to make you come up here but I really wasnt feeling well enough to go back to the office and well its the only chance I have to meet with you this week. Are you alright? Well its my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch. Oh Where did you eat? Pfeiffers. Ah. I know the chef there. Yeah. The foods usually terrific. My cousin worked for Bouchards. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.) What are you saying? Well you didnt hear it from me but needless to say if you go in there - stick with the consumee. Well wed better get started my daughters going to be here soon. Oh you have a daughter? Yeah she just turned fifteen last week. Aw thats a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.) Alright. The script. Now Ive read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous struggles not to vomit.) What? Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.) What? Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.) Im not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...? Pasta primavera. Ah. You know primavera is Italian for spring. No! Yeah. Really Im terribly sorry it just uh...all of a sudden it just hit me. So you were saying how um...about the script... Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.) More jokes? Another ending? A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.) Maybe we should go. We havent heard his notes yet we dont know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.) Oh God. Oh my god. I cant listen to anymore of this the guys losing a lung in there. (Russells daughter Molly enters.) Hello. Hi. Hi. Im Molly. Oh Im Jerry. George. Were here discussing our script with your father. He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.) Daddy? Are you okay? Yeah yeah sweetie. Im fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.) So you live with your mother huh? Uh yeah. Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid. Uh huh. Of course Im the result of my parents having stayed together so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.) Daddy are you alright? Whats the matter? Its just a stomach thing. Yuck. Were going to have to do this some other time so if youll give me your number Ill call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.) You know suddenly Im in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Mollys cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look but George stares hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.) Get a good look Costanza? What were you doing? Well its not my fault. You poked me! Youre supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building. Its cleavage. I couldnt look away. What am I waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life. Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun you dont stare at it. Its too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away. All right. So he caught me in a cleavage peek so big deal. Who wouldnt look at his daughters cleavage? Shes got nice cleavage. Thats why I poked. Thats why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.) Hey! What is with your friend Elaine? What? She comes to my restaurant comes right in my kitchen and starts complaining that Im talking about her shoes. She did? Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful. So I dont want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someones pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.) Pasta primavera? Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.) Shes somethin huh? Shes a wild one. Shes wearin me out. She is? Shes sensual. You know with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.) Hello? Oh hi Stu. From NBC? (to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) Whats goin on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag shocked.) If you hadnt gone into her restaurant this never would have happened. Look I dont like people talking about my shoes behind my back okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldnt have been looking at some fifteen year-olds cleavage anyway! He poked me! There was cleavage in the area. Thats a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke cleavage-poke... But she was fifteen. You dont consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level you cant control it! Were like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head. Alright whats the difference. What are we gonna do now? He wont take our calls we cant get into his office... You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant Pfeiffers? We could have Gail call us tell us the next time hes there go there and talk to him. Hey now youre onto something. The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldnt do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress. Yeah. Well maybe not Elaine. No. But...somebody like Gail though. Ya. What? What do you mean Gail? (Kramer enters.) Yah-hey. Kramer listen I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant ask her if she would call me. Alright Ill call her right now. Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.) What do you mean Gail? You dont think I can attract attention? You dont think I can put asses in the seats? Look sweetheart you know youve got it all. But lets face it... (Kramer comes back.) She said shell do it. Beautiful. Beautiful. But she wants the shoes. What? She says she wants those shoes. She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting em! No come on! Ill buy you another pair! No these were the last pair of these that they had! Ill get you another one just like it! No but these were the only really cool ones like this! Dont you see how everybody likes em and how everybody talks about em? (Jerry realizing Elaines motivation sits at the counter unbelievingly.) Elaine this pilot...it doesnt matter to me its not me Im concerned about...its my mother. Ive been over to the hospital to see her... Oh yeah because she caught you jer - Never mind! Oh come on wait a second this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size? Alright what size are you? Seven-and-a-half. Eh! Bingo. Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah hes here. Oh and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.) Hey! Whattaya know! Look whos here! Fancy meeting you here! Oh. Hello. Pasta primavera! Back on the horse. You know its a funny thing because after the pilot got cancelled we hadnt heard from you. Didnt hear anything... Didnt know...we were wondering...what happened. Well it just didnt seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So what were you saying? Oh...uh because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer? No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russells table.) Uh excuse me are you using that ketchup? Uh no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.) Because if Im looking straight ahead and something enters my field of vision thats merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russells attention.) Under the circumstances I dont really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.) Heres your ketchup back. You know I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble? No. Do you have a...ketchup secret? No I... (finally notices Elaine)...dont have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.) Because if you do have a ketchup secret I would really really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table sits down and waves at Russell.) Field of vision huh? Hows everything? Mmmm. Really good. This pasta primavera is fabulous. Very tasty. Howd everything go with that NBC guy? Great. The pilots back on. In fact Elaines going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen Elaine you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot youll of course tell him how much you liked it...? You know I happen to have the script right here with me and uh...on page 3 for example suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted and cant work. Uh...that kind of comedy thats a little broad for us. Well Im sure its right up Russells alley. Well its a funny idea. Its funny! Cmon funny is funny. Funny is funny were here to entertain right? Alright well maybe Ill mention it to Russell tomorrow night. If you can. Yeah. Wheres he taking you by the way? Bouchards on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine and attempts to tell Elaine something.) I think what hes trying to say is get the bouilla-base. (George nods yes and continues to choke.)]
56,4,17,[I dont want to *live*! I dont want to *live*! Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldnt want to live because of me? Im nothing! No... Youre *something*. You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. Im no good! Youre good. Youre *good*! Im bad. Im *bad*! Youre *killing* me! So what could I do? I couldnt go through with it. She threatened to kill herself. Over you? Yes. Why is that so inconceivable? I got two tickets to see Guys And Dolls. I got him a two-line phone. Unbelievable! Shes not there. What paper does she write for? The works for the NYU school newspaper. Shes a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me has no idea who I am. Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that... Yknow youve been developing quite the acid-tongue lately... [Proudly] Really? Hey who do you think is the most unattractive world leader? Living or all time? All time. Well if its all time then theres no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev. I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle? Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle. I got news for you. Golda Meir could make em all run up a tree. Yknow just because you two are homosexuals so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already. So whaddya say? You know youll always be the only man Ill ever love. [indignantly] Whats the matter with you? [quietly] Cmon go along... Im not goin along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me: Cmon Jerry go along go along... Yknow I hear that all the time. Hear what? That Im gay. People think Im gay. Yeah you know people ask me that about you too. Yeah cuz Im single Im thin and Im neat. And you get along well with women. I guess that leaves me in the clear... I just thought of a great name for myself if I ever become a porno actor. Oh yeah what? Buck Naked? Yeah how did you know that? You told me that already like two months ago. Allison bought it for me. How you gonna get out of *that* one? I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die. Hes gonna hang around if thats alright with you? Sure Id like to talk to him too. Jerry did you wash this pear? Yeah I washed it. It looks like it hasnt been washed. So *wash* *it*. You hear the way he talks to me? You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks to me... Let me ask you something. What do you think of this shirt? Its nice. Jerry said he didnt like it. I didnt say I didnt like it. I said it was O.K... No you said you didnt like it... Oh so what if I dont like it. Is that like the end of the world or something? So how did you two meet? Actually we met in the gym locker room. Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb the ropes and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs and then finally I slipped and fell on Jerrys head. Weve been close ever since. Do you guys live together? [quizzically] Live together? No I got my own place. And do your parents know? Know *what*? My parents? They dont know *whats* goin on... Oh God youre that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping on us. I *knew* you looked familiar! Theres been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole thing for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. Thats why my friend said all that. It was on purpose! Were not gay! Not that theres anything wrong with that... No of course not...

Peoples personal sexual preferences are nobodys business but their own! Why dont you take a seat? Thank-you. Why dont you take your coat off? So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it. She wouldnt take her coat off at my house either. Yknow there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep your coat on in somebodys house the families go to war! So you dont take your coat off and now everyone at NYU thinks Im gay. Not that theres anything wrong with that... Not at all. Two tickets to Guys And Dolls! Im gonna go with you! Guys And Dolls? Isnt that a lavish Broadway musical? Its Guys And *Dolls* not Guys And *Guys*. The Collected Works Of Bette Midler. What do you got there? Although they maintain separate residences the comedian and his long-time *companion* seem to be inseparable... Oh no! The Associated Press picked up the NYU story. Thats going to be in every paper! Ive been outed! I wasnt even in! Now everyones going to think were gay! Not that theres anything wrong with that... No not at all... Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad* Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over the cleanliness of a piece of *fruit* like an old married couple-- *I told you that pear was washed*! I thought we were friends... Here we go... I mean how could you two keep this a secret from me? Its not true! Aaaah! Enough lying! The lying is through! Cmon Jerry the masquerade is over.

Alright now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want to have dinner first or do you just want to meet at the theatre? Excuse me sir? I dont mean to bother you. I just wanted you to know that it took a lot of guts to come out the way you did and that youve inspired me to do the same even though that may mean a discharge from the service. Thanks.

Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness. [matter-of-factly] I dont believe it. You dont believe me? Ask Jerry. I will. What do you mean you will? Thats a bad idea. Jerry is a very private person. [Grabs Georges lapels] I want to hear it from *Jerry*... Oh can you ever forgive me? I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright* I forgive you... Yknow the funny thing is I was attracted to you immediately. I was attracted to you too. You remind me of Lois Lane. Jerry! Oh my God! What are you doing!?! What!? Youre with a *woman*! I know! What are you doin here?!? I leave you alone for two seconds and this is what you do! I trusted you! [forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell out of here! Whats going on?

58,4,19,[Oh hi Jerry. Hi Sidra. I usually last about ten minutes on a Stairmaster. Unless of course theres someone stretching in front of me in a leotard then I can go an hour. Really. Oh yeah. Thats why they call it a Stairmaster. You get up there and you stare. Well Im done. I think Im gonna go take a sauna. Alright Ill see you Thursday night right? Thursday night. Alright. Good workout? Tremendous workout. Thats a pretty girl. Tremendous girl. Shes the one you went out with last night? Yeah. I really like her. You know uh...theyre fake. What? Dont say that! Nah! Theyre fake! How do you know? I can tell. You know how youre always bragging how you can spot a lesbian? Im not bragging I happen to have a very keen lesbian eye. (A woman walks by Jerry and Elaine.) Hi how ya doin. (Jerry jerks a thumb at the woman to confirm his talent. Elaine is skeptical.) Oh right. Cmon dont you think they seem a bit too perfect? Yes they do! I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man. A leg man? Why would I be a leg man? I dont need legs. I have legs. Have you ever seen her naked in the locker room? No. Oh well then I cant accept your testimony. Maybe if you had seen her naked. I dont want to see her naked. Well I do. Well thats your problem. Look you made the allegation. The least you could do is follow up. Jerry what am I gonna do? Im gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna? Yes! Go in there! Do a little investigative journalism. I need to know! But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself! Dont be so sure. Look at George - hes on his ninth date with Betsy he still hasnt gotten anywhere with her. Whats his problem? Well every time he tries to make a move something screws up. Like on their last date they were on the couch but she was sitting on his wrong side. Wrong side? Yeah she was on his right side. He cant make a move with his left hand. Cant go left. He cant go left. No! Im lefty cant go right. What about women? Do they go left or right? Nah we just play defense. Can I ask you a question? Would you mind switching seats? Oh actually I really prefer to sit here. I dont hear very well out of this ear (points to her right ear) so I always try to sit to the right of people. Ill shout. Well I really think I feel more comfortable here. Cmon cmon...(stands up and physically rolls Betsy to the left side of the couch.) See now is that so bad? What? (The phone rings.) No no the machinell get it... No no its not on... Theyll call back. But George what if its an emergency? In the whole world right now theres maybe three emergencies. Why would you think on this entire planet that youre one of those three? George please. (Gets up and answers the phone.) Hello? What? (shocked) Oh my god! Alright maybe four. So whens the funeral? Well Aunt Clarice was so ill I guess it was really a blessing. (George on the couch behind Betsy is impatiently waiting for her to get off the phone so he can continue putting the moves on her. He shrugs and crosses himself.) Yeah Ill fly home as soon as I can. (George waves goodbye and mimics a plane flying through the air with his hand.) O.k. You too. Get some sleep. (Betsy looks at George and he manufactures a completely phony look of sorrow.) Youre sure? Positive! This chicks playin with confederate money. Well then thats it. Thats the end of that. What? Just cause of that? Just cause of that? Its like finding out Mickey Mantle corked his bat! Oh come on! Youve dated women with nosejobs whats the difference? You dont touch the nose! You dont aspire to reach the nose. You dont unhook anything to get to a nose and no man has ever tried to look up a womans nostril. Youve put a lot of thought into this havent you? Well I take it very seriously. You know sometimes when I think youre the shallowest man Ive ever met you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool. Hey. Hey. You know I do kinda wonder what fake breast feel like. Well I know what they feel like. You? How do you know? Well I lived in Los Angeles for three months. I thought you hated Los Angeles. I do! I just miss the warm weather yknow? Jeez. Oh man I wish I could get away. Real busy now down at the office? No. Huh? You know who I saw at the health club? Salman Rushdie. Yeah right Salman Rushdie. Yeah well I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you you wanna stay in pretty good shape. I know what the problem is - I like her too much. Thats why I cant make a move. You put her on a pedestal. I put them on a dental chair. He puts em on a dental chair. Im not her boyfriend. I want to be her boyfriend. Whoo. Its like a sauna in here. Thats funny. Youre a funny guy. Yeah funny. Yeah I never heard that before. (To George) So you goin to the funeral? Why you think I should? What are you kidding? Its a golden opportunity to advance the relationship. Shes crying you put your arm around her and console her...youre the consolation guy! Im the consolation guy...? Consolation Guy is big. Her aunt dying is the best thing that ever happened to you. Its like ten dates in one shot. This confers upon you instant boyfriend status. The familys there...youre taking care of things...youre gettin the sandwiches...youre the rock! Its in Detroit though its an expensive flight. Why dont you get a death in the family fare? What? You go to the airlines you tell them you got a death in the family? They give you 50% off the fare. Really? In fact listen...Ill go down there with ya. You know well tell them theres a death in my family you buy the ticket Ill split it...then Ill get the bonus miles and youll get to Detroit for a quarter of the price! So anyway we go out on one date he asks me out for a second then out of nowhere he cancels the date and says he doesnt want to see me again. Uh...sorry I couldnt help overhearing. Oh thats o.k. Did he give you a reason? Yeah. Hes going back to his old girlfriend. Really? He said shes mentally ill. Hes one of those guys who is obsessed with neatness and order? Everything has gotta be just so. He would have made a great Nazi. Hey does he ever talk about Superman? Yes! How did you know? Oh I know the type. So you can relate? Oh yeah. You know Ive seen you around the club. My names Sidra. This is Marcy. Oh hi. Im Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidras hand but stumbles and falls right into them.) So anyway I stood up to shake her hand then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her. You fell on her? I touched em. You what? I...touched...em. You touched em?! I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadnt been for them I could have really injured myself! Wow. Anyway...theyre real. Excuse me?! I think they might be real. Oh what do you know you have no breast touching experience. Ive touched mine! So have I. Oh right...I forgot. (smiles) Anyway touching two breasts doesnt make you an expert. Alright well anyway I think theyre real. And if they are I must say they are...spectacular. Aw what are you doin to me? (puts his head down on the counter.) You see my friend here his aunt passed away last night. Oh Im very sorry. I saw her last week she looked healthy and peaceful but...she knew... You poor thing! I...I... You dont think you can buy the ticket yourself...? No there there...you sit and Ill purchase the ticket for you. Youre a good friend. I understand you offer a 50%-off bereavement fare...? Yes all you have to do is pay the full fare now then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate and well refund half your fare. The death certificate? Yes yes we do need documentation or you know people could take advantage. What kind of a sick person would do a thing like that? I know! But it happens. You want my friend to ask his uncle a man who just lost his wife of 44 years for a death certificate so that he can save a few bucks on a flight? That would be $387 round-trip. Alright so youll need my frequent flyer number huh? Yes. I dont know one minute you say theyre fake the next minute you think theyre real...I dont know what to believe! Hey of the two of us Im the only one whos touched em. But you were just grabbing on to them to save your life. If you were drowning and I threw you a life preserver you think you could tell me if it was an inflatable? I wouldnt have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her! Well I dont mind someone with a phony personality but I gotta draw the line somewhere. Hey! Hey. George off to Detroit? Yep! And in two days Im off to Puerto Rico. Hey Kramer by the way I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie. Pffft - wrong. Theres Sidra. Theres Salman. Where? Talkin to that woman. Talkin to Sidra? If thats Sidra shes talkin to Salman. I dont think thats Salman. Well I dont think theyre real. If thats Rushdie theyre real. If theyre real thats Rushdie. Well I gotta know - Im talkin to Sidra. I gotta know Im talkin to Salman. Its like a sauna in here huh? I feel like Im...back at the desert. Oh yeah. Yeah Ive uh...Ive spent a little time in the Mideast. You ever been to the Mideast? My names Kramer. So uh...what kind of work do you do? Have you met my boyfriend George? No! (shakes Georges hand.) George this is Aunt May and Father Jessup. Oh and thats my brother Timmy. (Timmy smiles thinly.) This is my boyfriend George. Oh George how nice of you to come all this way. Well Im the boyfriend. Otherwise whats the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when youre the boyfriend. Betsy dear have you had anything to eat? Im not very hungry. They have some very nice snacks. Im about to get myself a snack. Oh no no no...you sit right here...I will get you a nice snack. This is my third wake this month. It never gets any easier. Well losing a loved is uh...I mean forget about it. (Starts wolfing down the sandwiches.) You seem to be of great comfort to Betsy were very appreciative. Oh - comfort schmomfort. Listen Father can I ask you a question? In a terrible time like this...who would I get the death certificate from? Cmon Jerry! Oh how can you be so sure? Jerry are you blind? Hes a writer. He said his name was Sal Bass. Bass Jerry! Instead of salmon he went with bass! He just substituted one fish for another! Look you idiot first of all its Salman not salmon! Jerry Jerry youre missing the big picture! Alright maybe it is but listen I gotta get ready - Sidras coming over in a few minutes so if you dont mind... What did you ask her? Im gonna find out tonight. Oh yes indeed... Why do you need a death certificate? Well Dr Allenwood uh...I was hoping to compile an - admittedly rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have and hold onto. Well I suppose I could make a copy of it. Oh that would be wonderful. It was very nice meeting you George. Likewise. What are you doing? What? Did...did you just double-dip that chip? Excuse me? You double-dipped the chip! Double-dipped? What are you talking about? You dipped the chip. You took a bite. (points at the dip) And you dipped again. So...? Thats like putting your whole mouth right in the dip! From now on when you take a chip - just take one dip and end it! Well Im sorry Timmy...but I dont dip that way. (takes a chip.) Oh you dont huh? No. (dips the chip) You dip the way you want to dip...(bites the chip) Ill dip the way I want to dip. (dips the chip again.) Gimme the chip! (Grabs George and the chip goes flying.) Gimme the chip! (They struggle in front of the snack table.) I dont know what Im doing here I must be crazy. (Moves to the couch and sits on the left side. Jerry tries to run over and beat her to it but doesnt make it. He sits down on the right side.) Hey would you mind switching seats? Why? Oh I dont know...I just like sitting to the left of people makes me feel like Im driving. O.K....(they switch places.) How ya doin? Good. How you doin? Good feel good...you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts. Really big huge...just coming out the top of her dress they were like chokin her. I hear thats how she died. Have you noticed that women today are you know they seem...bigger. Well a lot of women are having them done. Really? Yeah. How do you like that. A lot of people ask me if Ive had mine done. Aw you know people. It gets a little tiring its really none of their business. Oh the nerve. You know some people have asked me if youve uh done that. What do you tell them? Whatever you want me to tell them. Well I think youll find out soon enough. (They prepare to kiss. Theres a loud bang on the door.) Arent you going to get that? No. What if its an emergency? Oh theres no emergency... Jerry! Cmon its an emergency! Excuse me. (Gets up and answers the door.) Alright what is it? Youre interrupting! Well you know Im packing for Puerto Rico I need to borrow your bathing suit. This is an emergency? You need a bathing suit? Well I like yours. I dont know my bathing suit? Thats a little familiar I dont want your...your boys down there. Cmon whats wrong with my boys? Your boys should stay in their neighborhood. Alright cmon! Alright. Its in the top drawer. Hurry up. (Kramer goes to get the suit. Elaine enters.) Hi Jer. Oh hi Elaine. Oh...hi Sidra - Hi...Elaine? (Kramer comes back into the living room.) What are you doing here? Im looking for Kramer. Yeah she was just showing me pictures of places I can visit when I go to Puerto Rico...you know when you two went down there? Oh. yeah. Alright. (pushes Kramer and Elaine out the door then sits next to Sidra on the couch.) So where were we? I was just leaving. Right you were leaving. I cant believe you sent a woman into the sauna to do that. That was an accident! I think youre both mentally ill. (leaves then opens the door again.) And by the way...theyre real and theyre spectacular. (Sidra leaves.) Stop it George! Get out! Get out! I never want to see you again! Go back to New York! Get out! Well you see what happened was...the doctor - the very same doctor that was attending to my late aunt - suffered an untimely stroke and lost the use of his right hand so...obviously I was unable to get the death certificate. However I do have this. (Reaches inside his coat and takes out a Polaroid photo.) Thats a picture of me next to the coffin. Not even close huh?]
59,4,20,[You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that? (flips a roll of paper towels in the air) Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons and shapes. Everyones squeezing and smelling... It just happened. (laughs-hu) So whenre you gonna see her? Tonight. Whats her name? I... dont... know... How could you not know her name? I was a little nervous I got distracted. It has something to do with a car or a fish... Look at that. Why do I get bananas? Theyre good for *one* day... Oh my God I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from the State Controllers Office. Yknow when I was going to public school back in Brooklyn every week I used to put fifty cents in the Lincoln Savings Bank. Yeah I did that too. Yeah You remember the the little eh bank book there? Sure. Alright so I havent put anything in it since sixth grade I completely forgot about it. The State Controllers Office tracks me down. The interest has accumulated to 1900 dollars. 1900 dollars! Theyre sending me a cheque! Wow! Hu-Yeah interest. Its an amazing thing. You make money without doing anything... Yknow I have some friends who try and base their whole life on that principle. Really? Who? Nobody you know... Maybe Ill go down to the track. Put it all on a horse... Why dont you put it in the *bank*? The *bank*? This is *found* money. I want to *parlay* it. I wanna make a big score! *Oh* you mean you wanna *lose* it... Yeah... All right....Ya got it eh. Yes I did. Yes. Whats with the gloves? Well Im staining my floors yknow I dont want to get my hands dirty... Huh. What the whole apartment? The whole apartment.

Yeah exactly the triangle guy. Yeah you liked him. What happened with him? Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was ah just I dont know a little too... Artsy? Fat. Oh. (unh - very quiet sigh) He was a fat starving artist yknow. Thats very rare. Yeah. Anyway hes in the hospital hes having surgery and I feel like should go visit him. Whats wrong with him? Unh something with his spleen. Anyway itll just take five minutes O.K. and then the hospital is right on the way. Yeah. (putting hand to his mouth hatching a thought) All right well wait for you. Yeah maybe I can get some rubber gloves there huh yea. Listen Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you go into the room with me to visit him because ah I dont want him to think that Im yknow... interested. Oh you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend. Well... Well I think I can do that. I believe Ive played that role before to some critical acclaim. Aha ha ha (laugh) All right lets go. All right (picks up his sports bag) Yep yep yep. Whats with him? Yknow a lot of people have asked that... Roy! *Elaine*! What a *surprise*. (sitting up) (gasp) Oh my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so... Yeah ya know Ive lost some weight... A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically) I know. Aha hu You look *terrific*. Thank you. So do you. Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing) Ah This is... uh... you *really* lost weight. Thank you. Jerry uh Im the boyfriend. (puts his arm around Elaines shoulder but she shrugs it off twice) Doctor Wittenberg Outside call. Doctor Wittenberg Outside call. AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream) (a bit startled) Ahh. Doctor Wittenberg Outside call. Ah the mother lode! (the door squeaks a bit as he pushes it open) I cant believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldnt even get my arms around you... Yesss I remember. Ahahaha. Well thats the positive thing about getting sick you get to lose weight. Elaine it wasnt the illness. It was you. Me? (quietly- yeah) After you stopped seeing me I was devastated. I couldnt eat for weeks. *Get* *out*! Really its the truth. Jerry did you hear this? He couldnt eat for weeks... Thats terrible... I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you. You did. You know I cant get this *damn thing* to sleep. (about the Yo-Yo) Now listen Roy tell me something. When are you gettin out of here? Next Thursday. Okay Ill tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin... Honey... Arent we going to the Poconos next Friday? No thats the week after. No I believe its next week. Youre wrong. No Im not... Shut up... Pay dirt! (holding up the hand full of gloves. He looks behind himself as the door closes) Uh Roy this is uh Kramer -- hes one of our friends. Oh How do you do? Yeah... I do great yeah. Hi Roy. Oh hey Dr. Siegel. Hey Doc check this out. [does an around-the-world with the Yo-Yo] Heey. I *just* learned that. (proudly holding the Yo-Yo) A-hu. (The doctor is at a loss) I just wanted to stop by -- see if you had any questions about tomorrows operation. Ah Yeah Yeah I have a - I have a question um -- What do you know about inter-abdominal retractors? Are you asking because you saw 20/20 last night? I sure am. Well that report was about *one* very specific type of retractor and I can assure you we do not use that retractor in your friends procedure. But you *will* use... a retractor. We have to... Mmm-hmm... (turns and walks away makes a face raises his eyebrows nodding his head then turns back to the group.) Tell you what. Youre obviously concerned about your friends welfare. A few of my students will be observing tomorrows operation from the viewing gallery. How would you like to watch it with them? Id love to watch the operation yeah! I dunno... Oh come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. Theyre gonna cut him open -- His gutsll be all over the place... Yeah thats true... ...Theyll saw through bone. Uuuuuuuing yutyutyutyutn naannnaaa [makes saw noises while gesturing over Roys chest] Youll see whats *inside* bone... Ttu (wipes nose and sniffs) Ttu. Hey. Hi... What are doing you crying?? No... (takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes with his sleeve) You crying from Home Alone?? The old man got to me. Alright just get yourself together... I dunno if I can be friends with you anymore after this display. Oh Shut up! What are you doing back so soon anyway? (puts the tape back in its case.) Oh I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves wanted to come home and start working on his floor. Oh. Hows the guy? Oh hes okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting ah pretty chummy. Now Elaine wants me to buy some of his art. (opens the fridge and gets a bottle of water.) Hnh. Thats nerve... Yeah so she and Triangle Boy can go out to fancy restaurants. (takes a sip of water) Yknow what it is? Its Clara Nightingale Syndrome.  He falls ill; she falls in love. You mean Florence Nightingale. ** Whatd I say? Clara? Yeah you must have meant Clara Barton. ** Clara Barton? What did she do? Im not sure but I think she was nice. (takes a sip of water) Susan B. Anthony** I think Id have a problem with. Yeah I think you would. So you gonna buy his art? No. Why dont you buy it? You got 1900 dollars. Yeah thats what I want-- triangles. Alright Im outta here. Have fun with whats-her-name. I will. Yknow now you gotta ask her her name. Its so embarrassing. No it isnt. I can find out. Yeah? How? There are ways. Yknow I remember when I was a kid growin up kids would make fun of my name like you wouldnt believe-- Jerry Jerry Dingleberry and-hu Seinsmelled... Seinsmelled? Yeah. a-hu. What about you? Did people make fun of your name? Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy? (cont) Of course not everybody can be as sweet as you are. Oh oh Jerry... Oh... *you*... Now lets try breast... Celeste... Kest... No. Rest... Sest... Hest... Hest? Thats not a name. What you shouldve just asked her. I know I shouldve asked her. Whatre you gonna do now? I dunno. I cant ask her now; Ive already made out with her. Once you make out with a woman you cant ask her her name. Aretha! (points finger at Jerry) No... Bovary! (points finger again at Jerry) Alright thats enough. (sips coffee) Alright well you know whatcha gotta do you gotta go through her purse. Yknow the-the credit cards drivers license... How am I gonna do that? When she goes to the bathroom. Ah (smacks hands) there you are. My date stood me up. Listen will you guys go to the operation with me? You asked a date to go to the operation? Yeah... So cmon  (smacks hands and rubs them together) what dyou say? What kind of operation is it? Spleenectomy. Isnt that where they remove the-- No No Dont ruin it for me I havent seen it yet! Ah-Cmon what dyou say? Mulva! (again pointing finger at Jerry -- Kramer watches the exchange back and forth) Mulva? (waves off George with his hand) Cmon Cmon. You wanna go? (pats Jerry a couple times on the shoulder quietly) Cmon. Yeah yeah yeah. Alright alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then well watch em go slice this fat bastard up. (sips coffee) Now well open the peritoneal cavity exposing the bodys internal organs. Nurse-- retractor. What are you eating? Junior Mints. Do you want one? No... Now I cant see..... Psst.... Psst... ... Cou ye ge... Y-ea (pours a few more Junior Mints into his hand and eats them) Whered you get those? The machine. You want one? No. Here take one. I dont want one. No theyre good! Take one.. I dont want any! Just take one. No! Stop it! Kramer stop it! (pointing at the operation he mouths the words) Did it go in? Ge-- ...Over the balcony bounced off some respirator thing *into* the patient! What do you mean into the patient? Into the patient *literally*! Into the hole? Yes the hole! Didnt they notice it? No! How could they not notice it?!? Because its a little mint. Its a *Junior* Mint. W-ca-What did they do? They sealed him up with the mint inside. They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him? Yes! I-I guess it cant hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those things. Yes they *eat* them. They dont put them next to vital organs in their abdominal cavity! Yeah. Its me. Come on up. Hey. This wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like a ski lodge! Why did you force that mint on me? I told ya I didnt want the mint! Well I didnt believe you. How could you not believe me?!? Well whos gonna turn down a Junior Mint? Its chocolate its peppermint-- its *delicious*! Thats true. Its very refreshing! Well just dont say anything about this to Elaine... Prognosis... negative. Prognosis *negative*!? Hes not doing well the doctors dont know what it is. Theyre baffled. Oh my God... Just my luck yknow... just when hes getting thin and attractive. Yknow Jerry you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits. Its that bleak? (pours a glass of milk) Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom) Yknow if the guy dies the art could really be worth something... We gotta confess. Really? Yes! We could be tried for murder... I cant have this on my conscience. Were like Leopold and Loeb! ** Youre not gonna say anything you got that? Im telling and you cant stop me! Youre *not*!!! Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1900 dollars worth. Oh yeah thats the spot... Whatre you so tense about? Oh nothing really just a homicide. [She finds the right spot on his back] Oh thats terrific... Mulva. What? Mulva? Mulva? Oh my eh my Aunts name is Mulva. Shes-shes a masseuse. huh. Yeah. Um Im going to the bathroom. Ill be right back. Oh good idea... What are you doing? Oh I was just looking for er some... gum or... mint. Oh I have Junior Mints. No! [throws her purse back at her] No I mean no thank you nah... Any news? [whispering] No no news. You better get out of here. Oh. Oh No wait a second... Wait a second... I-I dont know the name of this woman in the bathroom so when she comes out you introduce yourself and then shell be forced to say her name. 10-4. O.K. (closes the apartment door) Oh hello. Hello Im Kramer. Nice to meet you. See you later. (He promptly turns and leaves) Well I better get going. I dont want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.) Oh okay. Yknow my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis. Oh Hey theres a name you dont forget. Mm. Bye Jerry. Bye. Oh hi. Oh Hi Im George. (they shake hands) Oh Nice to meet you George. Yeahaha I gave it a shot (pats Jerry on the arm)... So any word on the artiste? (puts a video in the VCR) No I havent heard anything. Hehe. Well I got my triangles. (sitting on the couch) Really... Yup yknow they really spruce up the apartment. Yeah Im sure... Well I-I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell em what happened. No-no Jerry. I wouldnt do that. Why? Ehh You could get in trouble. Look I gotta try and help the guy. Who are you to play God!? Every mans time comes! If his number is up who are you to interfere!? Yes Id like to speak with Dr. Siegel... its about Roy Kordics condition... W-What? What? Oh thats *fantastic*! He didnt get better did he? Thank you very much. O.K. Bye-bye. Hes gonna be okay! Wheres the luck? Theres no luck. 1900 dollars down the drain. You saved my life George. You buying my art is what inspired me to get better. Ill never forget whatcha did for me. Oh well th-thats great. Its really great. Hm hm mm. Yknow arts a great investment. And theyre gonna look great in your apartment George. Yes I look forward to many years of... looking at the triangles. Well Ill ah Ill wait for you outside. Hey George... Yeah. Awe alright Thats nice. Thanks Roy. Heeyy - theres the guy who saved my life. (points at the doctor.) Yknow... I dont want to totally discount the emotional element in your recovery but I think there were other factors at play here. What do you mean? I have no medical evidence to back me up but something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps from above... Mint? Those can be very refreshing. So Elaine... Where are we going for our big dinner on Friday? (takes a big mouthful of spaghetti) Uh-m uh Im so sorry Roy but actually we are going to the Poconos on Friday right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?) I dont think so... We are... that means that we ah we are... I believe were not... (Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh Please can we go to the Poconos? Well Ill think about it... Great seats. You could see the actors spitting. Really... Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill. Oh Wait a second you got her autograph? Yeah. Do you have it with you? Yeah its in my purse. Ah Leme see. (hands Jerry the playbill) Yknow I really think Im falling for you Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up a quick  kiss on the cheek and hugs him.) Oh well I really think Im falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia... I had it autographed for my uncle. Yeah I-I know... (licks he lips) You dont know my name do you? Yes I do. What is it? It-it rhymes with a female body part. What is it? Mulva... Aub ah Gipple? Loleola? Oh! Oh! *Delores*! Ages zero through ten candy is your life. Theres nothing else. Family friends school-- theyre only obstacles in the way of getting more candy. And you have your favorite candies that you love. You know the ones I love those... I hate those.... ``I hate those... I love those.... And only a seven year old kid could actually taste the difference between like a red M&M and a light brown M&M. Thats two totally different things when youre seven years old. Well your red is more of a main course M&M but the brown its more of a mellower flavor; its an after dinner M&M really.]
60,4,21,[...And it *is* embarrassing because a doggie bag means either you are out at a restaurant when you arent hungry or youve chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food that there is. How about the doggie bag on a date? Thats a good move for a guy huh? Lemme tell you something: if youre a guy and you ask for the doggie bag on a date you might as well have them just wrap up your genitals too. Youre not going to be needing those for awhile either. Is that bothering you? No not at all... Oh could you please hurry? [mockingly] Please hurry. Look at you. Look at what youve become. What? What have I become? I havent become anything... Oh *Carl* cant wait a few more minutes? I dont want to keep him waiting... Hell like you more... Thats impossible... Andrew why do you have to pick your teeth at the table? Leave me alone. Yeah Im wanting to get married *real* soon... So where am I dropping you? His place... This guys got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and then drop you off at his apartment... *And* he gets the rest of my chicken... So is tonight the night? You never know... Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*! Boy do you smell something? Do I smell something? What am I hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something. What is it? I think its B.O.! What? Its B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O. It *cant* be. Nobody has B.O. like this. Jerry. Its *B*.*O*. But the whole car smells. So? So when somebody has B.O. the O usually stays with the B. Once the B leaves the O goes with it. I cant believe you ski! Im a great skier. Yeah? What else? Lets see... I ski I fish I pillage I plunder... [delightedly] Oh! You pillage and plunder? ...When I travel. See? Finally *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! Im so lucky. Thisll only take a second. Yeah Im going to poke around... [to himself] Hey whatdya know? Look at that! A *lesbian* sighting. Oh-ho! My lucky day. Theyre *so* fascinating. Why is that? Because they dont want us. You gotta respect that... [to himself] Oh my God! Its Susan! What do I do? George? [to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh boy! What are you doing here?! Renting a video! What do you got there? Oh ... some stupid movie... This is Mona. Oh hi... Pleasure to meet you. Yes. Well... Well Ill let you two uh... catch up. You okay? Yeah. Yes! I just havent seen you in a long time. And you didnt expect me to be holding hands with a woman. Oh *please*! Me? Cmon! Thats *great*! Are you kidding? I think thats fan*tastic*! Ive always encouraged experimentation! Im the first guy in the pool! Who do you think youre talking to? I *know* who Im talking to. Of course you do... Its just uh yknow I-I never *knew* uh that uh... I liked women? There you go. So uh how long has this been going on? Since you and I broke up. Ssssso after me you... went that way? Yeah. Oh I think thats fantastic. Good for you. Nice. Thats very nice. So what have you got there? Oh I uh-- Oh ``Rochelle Rochelle Its a foreign movie... a *film* is what it is actually. Yeah... A lot of nudity in that huh? No no no... Just a *tiny* bit... Its not even *frontal* nudity. Its... *sidal* nudity... Next. Oh thats me. Alright well... Good seeing you George. Yes good to see you too. And Good luck with uh... with the whole thing there. Uh what are you returning? [embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle Rochelle. Ah ``Rochelle Rochelle... A young girls strange erotic journey from Milan to Minsk... Uh thatll be uh... $3.49. $3.49? It says $1.49. Well you didnt rewind it. Theres a $2.00 charge for not rewinding. What! Theres no signs here! This is an outrage! George dont give him any money for that. Itll cost you less to keep it another day rewind it and bring it back tomorrow. Dont give him the satisfaction. Im not giving you the satisfaction. Im gonna watch it again... So this morning I go down to the garage to check the car out. I figure by this time the odour molecules have had at least twelve hours to de-smellify. I open the car door like a *punch* in the *face* the stench hits me-- its almost as if it had *gained* strength throughout the night... Yknow I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than whats livin in your car. What about skunk? I dont mind skunk. Horse manure? I *loooove* horse manure. Well Ive never seen anything like this in my life. In fact I went to the car wash they want 250 dollars to detail it and get the smell out. Im not payin for that. Thats not my responsibility. In fact Im drivin up to that restaurant now and *demand* they pay for it. Absolutely. Listen lemme ask you something. When youre with a guy and he tells you he has to get up early what does that mean? It means hes lying. Wow... Why? Is that what he told you? Yeah last night. Oh come on... Men *have* to get up early some time... No. Never. Jerry! Im *sure* Ive seen men on the street early in the morning. Well sometimes we do actually have to get up early but a man will *always* trade sleep for sex. Is it possible Im not as attractive as I think I am? Anythings *possible*... Whats the matter with you? Steinbrenner! Hes ruinin my life... Oh yeah Steinbrenner... I dont think I can take another season with him Jerry. Hell just trade away their best young prospects just like he did with Beuner McGee Drabek... McGriff... I know the list... Whats that smell? What smell? Ooooh... You stink. Whatdya mean I stink? You *stink*. Why dont you go take a shower? I showered! Oh wait a second... Since I showered Ive been in the car! So? Dont you see whats happening here? Its attached itself to me! Its alive! If it attached itself to you then... Oh my God! Thats why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry he thinks I have B.O.! Me! What happened? What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And its destroying the lives of everyone in its path. What is that? B.O.? Yeah. This is *unbelievable* B.O. I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy told me in his 38 years in the business hes never smelled anything like it. So let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this? No no. Its the valet guy. No no I mean driving Susan to lesbianism. Oh... No thats ridiculous. What if her experience with me *drove* her to it? Suicide maybe not lesbianism. The woman shes lesbianing with? Susan told me shes *never* been with a guy. Oh this isnt even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! Its *B*.B.O.! There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like a Smell Gestapo. To sniff em out strip em down and wash them with a big soapy brush... Yknow the funny thing is somehow I find her more appealing now... Its like if I knew she was a lesbian when we went out I never wouldve broken up with her. Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought... Here he is... thats the guy! (rolls up window) No thank you go back... go back... Ill park it! You go back! What do you mean-- stunk up? I mean the car *stinks*! George does the car stink? Stinks. Stinks! Well perhaps *youre* the one who has the odour... Hey Ive never smelled in my *life* buddy! Really? Well I smell you now. Thats from the car! Well maybe *youre* the one who stunk up the car rather than the car stinking up you! Oh its the chicken and the egg... Thank you very much... Well then go out and smell the car; see which smells worse. I dont have time to smell cars. Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the source... Youve gotta smell the car Im a busy man Cmon! One whiff! Alright one whiff... Alright! I give up! I admit it! It stinks! Now will you let me out! Alright will you pay for the cleaning? Yes! 50 dollars! Ill give you 50 dollars! Im not paying for *that*. Theyve already got my seven dollars... [sarcastically] ...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk... The valet had such bad B.O.? Oh man just *rampant* **mutant** B.O. The O went from the valets B to the car to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks its an entity. But I showered and I shampooed so... Thats a relief... What? Its still there... No no no! It *cant* be! I shampooed! I rinsed! I repeated! Listen I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that perhaps I was responsible in some way for your uh... metamorphosis. Thatll be $98.00. What $98.00? Thats what I said. $98.00. How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!? So was it me? Oh dont be ridiculous! Is that what you wanted to talk to me about? [Gives him the $35] Here. Oh thanks. Thanks a lot. Ill pay you back. Yeah *sure*... I gotta go. Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were ever to... dance how do you decide who leads? I mean... do you take turns? Do you discuss it beforehand? How does that work? Youre an idiot. Why? Thats a *legitimate* sociological question. Ill see ya. And George by the way... You stink... Real bad. Its not me! Its the car! I didnt think Id come. I knew you would. Oh Kramer! We spray everything with Ozium-D let it de-ionise vacuum the spray out with a de-ionising machine. Hit it with high-pressure compressed air and wet-dry vac it to extract the remaining liquids. We top it off with one of our seven air-fresheners in your case I would recommend the Jasmine or the Potpourri. Lets do it. The first thing were gonna do is flush the follicles with the five essential oils. Then we put you under a vapour machine and then a heated cap. Then we shampoo and shampoo and condition and condition. Then we saturate the hair in diluted vinegar-- two parts vinegar 10 parts water. Now if that doesnt work we have one last resort. Tomato sauce. Tomato Sauce? Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells! It still smells. It still smells! How could it still smell after all that? I dont know! Well what are you gonna do? Ill tell you what Im gonna do Im selling that car! Youre *selling* the car!? You dont understand what Im up against. This is a force more powerful than anything you can imagine. Even *Superman* would be helpless against this kind of stench. And Ill take anything I can get for it. Maybe Ill buy it. Are you crazy? Dont you understand what Im saying to you? This is not just an odour-- you need a *priest* to get rid of this thing! I still smell! You see! You see what Im saying to you? Its a presence! Its the beast! Kramer! Kramer! Kramer open up I know youre in there! Susan! Kramer! What is going on? You know whats going on? First he vomits on me. Then he burns down my fathers cabin. And now hes taken Mona away from me. He stole your girlfriend? Yes. Shes in *love* with him. Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism he brings em back. Thats the *least* of what youve accomplished... Wait a minute wait a minute. Kramer Kramer... Hold on a second. I dont get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life-- Im Kramer. I know what youre going through. Women. Who knows what they want? I just dont know what she sees in *Kramer*. Listen. Youre beautiful. Youre intelligent. Youll meet other girls... You think so? Yes I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian. Youre very sweet... Hey I know what Im talking about. I gotta be honest with you I gotta tell ya... Ever since I saw you holding hands with that woman I cant get you out of my mind. Really? Yeah youre just so... hip. Oh my God... What? Its Allison. I dated her right after you. Shes obsessed with me. George? Allison! Hi! Oh my God! How are you? Good. You know you owe me $50... Right. I dont have it on me. Allison this is Susan. Susan Allison. Nice to meet you... Nice to meet you... Thats a beautiful vest... Thank you... I dont understand it. I was with her last night in my apartment; it was very romantic. Yknow with that fake wood wallpaper the atmosphere is *fabulous* in there now. Its like a ski lodge. What year did you say this was? 90. Anyway we were on the couch I move to hug her next thing she tells me shes leaving; shes got to get up early. Thats strange... How many miles you got on this thing? 23 000. And I was looking good too. I had a nice new shirt on Im wearing *your* jacket... Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The Beast! I cant sell this car. This... **thing**... has got to be stopped! So what do you want to do? Sauce me.]
61,4,22,[Hey is it my imagination or do really good looking women walk a lot faster than everybody else? We dont walk that fast... No seriously... Seriously we dont. The better looking they are the faster they go! I mean I see they out there on the street theyre zooming around like a blur. Like they have a motor on their ass. (Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry come on lets go. Were gonna miss the previews! Hey how are we gettin to Scott Drakes party on Saturday night? Oh Drakes party I forgot to buy a present.

What about your fathers car? No no no. Out of the question. I was over there today. Hes got the good spot in front of the good building in the good neighbourhood. I know hes not gonna wanna move. Are you serious? You dont know what that spot means to him. Once he gets it he doesnt go out for weeks. How about this you put your car in the good spot thatll hold the good spot in front of the good building and we can get the good car! Good thinking! Good to meet you! So what are we gonna get him? We could get him anything we wanted were chippin in. I like this area. I could live out here. Yeah we ought to all get a house and live together. Yeah thats a good idea. Ill tell you what chuckles I give you permission to sublet my room right now. Look at this. Theres no spaces here. (to another car) Excuse me are you gettin out? No! Why dont you take a handicap spot... You think? No no! Well find a space. Theres spaces in the other lot. I dont want to walk that far. What if a handicapped person needs it? Oh come on they dont drive! Yes they do! Have you ever seen a handicapped person pull into a space and park? Well theres spaces there they must drive! Well they dont. If they could drive they wouldnt be handicapped. So if you can drive youre not handicapped? Look were not gonna be that long anyway... we have to get to the party! I got news for you: handicapped people they dont even want to park there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! Thats why those spaces are always empty. Hes right! Its the same thing with the femenists. You know they want everything to be equal everything! But when the check comes where are they? What does that mean? Yeah! Alright Im pulling in. Yeah go ahead. George! Oh come on its five minutes. Make sure we dont forget where the cars parked. Dont worry. We wont forget! Do you believe the deal we got on this? A big screen TV? At that price? What a sale huh? And how about that store delivering it tonight? Were gonna be swimming in thank yous... What did I get the veggie burger for? You got a veggie burger so I had to get the veggie burger Im allover crums... No-ones gonna have a better gift than this big screen TV! Good for them love the Drake! Got to *love* the Drake! Hey whats going on over here? Must have been an accident... (to a woman) Hey whats going on? Some jerk parked in a handicap spot so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline and half way up her batteries gave up and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeths... Is she OK? I dont know. Were just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? Hes gonna pay! Sons of bitches! Good luck finding them... him... whatever. Id like to stick around and get my hands on him myself but I gotta take off. How are we gonna get out of here? Theyll kill us! (to George) Are you happy now? Who would think these people were gonna be here? I dont know... What about the party? What about the Drake? Screw the Drake! I love the Drake! Lets just take a bus back to the city. Cant leave the car here! Why not? Its my fathers car! Lets smash it! Yeah! Yeah! Lets get out of here. What are we gonna do? How are we gonna get out of here? The thing is even if we go back by the car and theres nobody there how do we know theyre not all hiding waiting for us? Well they have to give up some time they cant stay out there all night? What are we John Dillinger? How did this get to be the crime of the century? Its not like we stuck a broomstick in her spokes and she went flying... What I dont get is just because the battery is dead you think shed be able to roll up the hill with her hands! Youd think... I mean batteries have gone dead before arent they prepared for that? Most of them dont even have batteries. Must be one of those rich spoiled handicapped people who didnt want to do any work and just wanted to sit in her wheelchair and take it easy. Yeah... Well Im sorry! Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now... How are we gonna get out of here? We need a plan! I got it! (snaps his fingers) We give the keys to Elaine. Me? Yeah! Youre a woman! Men dont hit a woman! Oh they wont? Not if they dont know you... Im not going for this Kramer should go! It was all his idea! No chance in hell! What if we created some sort of diversion? What if we all went by the car and started screaming: There he is theres the guy that took the handicap spot! And then when they all run into the other direction well jump in the car! Thats good well give it a try... Thats good... That doesnt work well give em Kramer! Huh? (as George picks up a broken piece of his car) You know a lot of these scratches will buff right out... Eight years have I had this car. Not a scratch on it! Eight years! A beautiful Mercury! I special-ordered that bench seat! Dad that other car cut us off! They had swastikas all over it... They were hurling racial epiphates at us... I could have been killed! (to Frank) I told you not to give it to him! (to George) You know my insurance doesnt cover this? The whole thing is a total loss! Frank the important thing is he didnt get hurt! No it isnt! So what are you doing now Georgie? Im uh... writing a pilot for NBC... Where the hell is my paper? Youre writing a pilot? With his friend Jerry Seinfeld... the comedian... So whats it about? Well Jerrys car gets hit and the other driver doesnt have any insurance so the judge This is the same situation! Frank maybe you ought to make him your butler! Every time youre with that Kramer something happens... Hes a real trouble maker! Nah he didnt have anything to do with it... Hes all together crazy that one! Jerry? I used to think was nice... I dont know what happened to him... (to the Drake) So it was a good party huh? Oh... youre welcome youre welcome... (to Elaine) They loved the TV *loved* it! Oh yeah... (to the Drake) Oh wait a second Ill ask her.. thats a great idea. (To Elaine) Drake wants to know if we want to come out to Minneolis this afternoon since we missed the partly last night to maybe get something to eat? Sure! (to the Drake) Sure! ... Okay... Dont worry Im taking MY car! ... okay... okay see you later... bye... The Drake is great! Hmm.. hes so nice! Im really happy for them. Yeah. Well I dont know if Im happy for them I mean Im glad theyre happy but frankly that doesnt do anything for me. Yes? Its me. Come on up. Hey. I just came from St. Elizabeths. St. Elizabeths Hospital? Why? Well the handicapped woman? I went to see her. You went to see her? Yeah. Wow what happened? Im in love. What? Yeah she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love her Jerry I really love her. Im gonna ask her to marry me. Shes got everything Ive always wanted in another human being. Except for the walking. Oh whats the difference you dont go out that much. Ah Im glad youre here. What? Alright now we gotta go out. We gotta buy a wheelchair. A wheelchair? What for? Well you know I went to the hospital today and I saw the woman you know and the wheelchair is totalled we gotta get her another one! Doesnt she have collision? George Im in love with her! Well my father works for the United Volunteers maybe he can get her one. No! She needs it now! What about these two? Arent they gonna chip in? Well... Hey we told you not to park there! Cant we just fix the old one? Alright alright. Fine George! Dont chip in! But some day were gonna be driving along were gonna look out the window and see her crawling along 5th avenue! Is that what you want? Alright alright! Well buy her a wheelchair! Wheelchairs engagement presents.. IT NEVER ENDS! This is out best model. The Cougar 9000. Its the Rolls Royce of wheelchairs. This is like... youre almost glad to be handicapped. So now whats this got? Inductive joystick dynamic braking flip-up arms its fully loaded. I put Stephen Hawking in one of these two months ago hes lovin it! Its rated number one by Hospital Supply and Prosthetic Magazine. How much? 6200. Do you have something a little more... less expensive? Hey Drake! Hi Drake! My God this is fantastic! Tell me were you guys just blown away or what? Oh yeah yeah... its fantastic... I am gonna make good use of this! Im watching every superbowl here every big fight.... Oh man there is nothing like a really big TV huh? So wherere we eatin? Well actually... Jerry... Im *really* hungry! ... we just broke up... When did this happen? About 20 minutes ago... Hey I am really sorry about this guys... whew! (looking at the TV) Look at the picture on this thing... Oh cristal clear! They know how to make em... Are there any good Italian restaurants around here? (through his sobbing) Gaglianos... thats pretty good... Well... we should... Get movin... Yeah... Hey Drake what ever happens I am sure itll be for the best. Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison! Oh the remote! Okay Im just gonna put it on top of the television... Alright this one is about 8 years old. Not a scratch on it it was owned by some lady who only used it to go from the bathroom to the kitchen and to feed her cat. But thisll get you around? Oh sure it just doesnt have any of the thrills of the Cougar. Like what? For example your tremor-damping. Now whats that? It helps to control the direction regardless of the operators tremors or spasticity. Well is it alright if I try it? Hop in! Oh yeah! I tell ya... When I see someone enjoying themselves like that it reminds me why I got into this business in the first place. How much? How about $240? Well take it! Drake gave her the TV? He gave her all the gifts; he felt guilty. Well she cant keep it its not fair thats *our* TV! I know it is! Boy I am really starting to dislike the Drake! I hate the Drake! Maybe the whole thing was a scam. Anybody can just get engaged and get presents and just keep them all. Maybe theyre on their way to Chicago tomorrow and do the whole thing all over again. They dont know anybody in Chicago. Dont worry theyll make friends fast with that nice TV. Hey. Hey guess what? The Drake broke up. I dont know about defraying. Why? Were not gettin that TV. What do you mean? The engagement is off we get the TV back. Thats business. The Drakette took it. She cant take it. Its not hers its theirs. Once theres no theirs theres no hers it should be ours. Well she has it! (upset) I *told* you the Drake was bad! I hate the Drake! Maybe we should call her. Well whos gonna call? You are. What? Why is it me who always has to do these things? Because thats your thing! What? Calling people I hardly know and demanding they return expensive gifts thats my thing? Yeah thats your thing. Alright gimme the phone... its my thing... (to George) You know Im thinking about getting a yo-yo. Really? Yeah. I could see that... Alison! Hi this is Elaine... Oh Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake... Everybody does. Bye-bye.... She gave it to charity. Charity?!? Thats apalling. How could anybody be so selfish and inconsiderate! Well I gave her the wheelchair! You should have seen the look on her face. And then she told me that the old wheelchair that wasnt any good anyway! So you see George the whole incident was a God blessing! Yeah! You mean a blessing in disguise? Yeah.... And I would also like to personally thank our gracious host Frank Costanza who has earned the silver circle award and is our unanimous choice for the United Volunteer Representative of the Month! Due to his tireless effort he personally raised over $22000. Thats a lot of wheelchairs! On behalf of the United Volunteers of Greater New York we thank you! Well... thank you very much! Mr. Costanza? Yes? Youre under arrest. Under arrest? What for? Reckless endangerment of public safety and violation of traffic code 342-A. Whats that? Parking in a handicap spot. Lets go... George! George! Your father got arrested? For what? Parking in a handicap spot. Right in the middle of his United Volunteers meeting. When he got back he chased after me with a baseball bat. Ho-ly! Between the car getting totalled the towing charge and the fine theres no way I can ever pay him back... So what are you gonna do? I agreed to become his butler. What? Whats the matter? Its over! Whats over? Me and Lola.... The woman we bought the wheelchair for? Yeah she dumped me! She dumped you? She dumped me! She rolled right over me! Said I was a hipster dufus. Am I a hipster dufus? (hesitatingly) ... no... Said Im not good looking enough for her. Not good looking! Jerry look at me look at my face huh am I beautiful? George am I beautiful? ...youre very attractive... yeah... she says she doesnt wanna see me again. Told me to drop dead! Drop dead? Boy even I never heard that one... Shes pretty rough! Yeesh-jip! Well we just blew 240 bucks on a wheelchair. 240 bucks? Well it was slightly used... Used? What!? Youre supposed to your face there! Do you see your face in there? Yeah? ...oh really?...oh... how about that?... Right down a hill huh? Okay! Alight! Bye! George forget about the shoes. Want you to do something for me (scribbles something on a piece of paper). This handicapped woman had an accident. Somebody gave her a used wheelchair with defective brakes. Sons of bitches! Anyway I want you to pick up this big screen TV and deliver it to her. Big screen TV? Do you think you can handle it? Yes? Hi were from the United Volunteers weve come to pick up the TV. Oh great its right over there. Ooh its a big one! Whos got the receipt? I do. Will they give us cash? Thats their policy. I hate this mall there are never any spaces here... Why dont you park in front of the hydrant? What if there is a fire? What are the chances of that?]
62,4,23,[To me the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type meetings for these people? Theyll go: Hi my name is Bill and the one thing Im worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored couch. According to most studies peoples number-one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now this means to the average person if you have to go to a funeral youre better off in the casket than doing the eulogy. Why cant I play Kramer? Look weve been through this already. Youre not an actor! Neither are you. I know. So why do we need two people in the show that cant act? Oh come on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something Ill pretend its funny. My grandmothers in the hospital. Ha ha ha. Your grandmothers in the hospital! This is real believable. What you didnt think I was really laughing? It stinks. Let me see you do it. Say something funny. Alright. Ive never been to Mars but I imagine its quite lovely. Ah.......... Mine was better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again Jerry too) Why are two pretending to be laughing? Were acting. (they stop laughing) Oh real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC? No. I dont understand. Theyre supposed to be casting this week. Somethings wrong. Maybe theyre not doing it. (to Jerry) Well at least let me audition. (to George) He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot. (to George) Yeah! Out of the question. Oughh! (to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? Whats with this Russel? Whats he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesnt know) I really appreciate you coming. Oh thats O.K. I dont have much time though. So... All right first of all I want to apologize for all the phone calls. Its just--Its just-- (awkward pause) I dont understand we went out once... That was two months ago. Yes I know. I just-- I cant get you out of my mind. Ever since that-- that day in the restaurant when we met... (we see a flashback from The Shoes of Elaine showing her cleavage and asking Russell for his Ketchup secret) Russell you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table) But I want you. God I hate these mixtures. Why dont they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good but I dont know how eats these cheesy things (she does). Is it something I said... or did? Um... Look Russell... Youre a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I dont like television... and thats your world. Thats your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I dont know... Greenpeace or something that would be different but network television... I mean come on Russell youre part of the problem. Oh Elaine were doing some really very interesting things right now. Weve got some very exciting pilots for next season. We have one with a bright young comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Oh yeah oh yeah. Ive heard of him. Hes that Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that? guy. Yeah. Anyway its a ground breaking show. Really? What is it about? (a little more enthusiast) Well really its very unusual. Its about nothing. (surprised) What do you mean its about nothing? (starts doing George at the first meeting with NBC in The Pitch) For example what did you do today? Um I got up. Um I went to work. Then I came here. Theres a show. thats a show. Russell see Im really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So... (stops doing George hes down again) Elaine When--when--when are we gonna see each other again. Im sorry Russell. Im sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell still sitting watches her leaving). Hello? Yeah hes here. (to Kramer) Hey! Its for you. Hes getting phone calls here now? (hes standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag) (to George) Again with the sweat pants? What? Im comfortable. You know the message youre sending out to the world with these sweat pants? Youre telling the world: I give up. I cant compete in normal society. Im miserable so I might as well be comfortable. (George is baffled) (to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah hell call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other) (to Kramer) Who is it? Thats NBC. NBC!?! Give me the phone! Im in the middle of a conversation here. Get off the phone! (to the phone) Look Ill call you back. (hangs up) You know Im waiting to hear from them. Who was it? Russell Dalrimples secretary. All right. Now youre doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah its Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot. (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. Were in business baby the pilots on. Youre gonna successful. (George looks disappointed) What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series? Thatd be wonderful George youll be rich and successful. Yeah thats exactly what Im worried about. God would never let me be successful. Hed kill me first. Hed never let me be happy. I thought you didnt believe in God? I do for the bad things. Do you hear what youre saying? God isnt out to get you George. What... What is that on your lip? What? Its like a discoloration. Its white. (gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes its white. Why its white. Youd better get that checked out. Better get that checked out? I would. What kind of a therapist are you? Im telling Im scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me right away you start looking for tumors? Im trying to help you. What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels you can make em feel worse. I bet youre rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her) I think youd better go. Oh Im going baby! Im going! (he leaves) Where? Right here. (showing his lip) Get out of here its nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See The Heart Attack) (to the cab driver) Excuse me do you see anything on my lip here? Yeah its like a discoloration. Oh my God. Yeah its all white. (to Jerry) Its all white Jerry! Its all white! Would you stop? I would get that checked out if I were you. Again with the checked out. Im not going to the doctor. If I dont to the doctor then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something. If you go maybe theyll catch it in time. Catch what in time? Whatever it is. You think its something? Ah! I hate these bums with their filthy rags. No no no I dont want it get away get away from my car (he starts his wipers) (to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! Its crazy Joe Devola. (through the opened windows cab) Good luck on the pilot Jerry. (the cab pulls away) (to George) Yeah I think I see it. Its like a white discoloration. (to Jay) What do you think it is? Its like a... white discoloration. (we understand now why a sitcom needs so many producers) O.K. guys are we ready to start? Yeah where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here. Oh you know I dont know. I saw him in the hall this morning I said hello to him. He walked right past me. He must be worried about the fall schedule. Ah its a real bear. Yeah. So whats going on? Were gonna shoot the pilot and then its gonna be on TV the following week? Yeah. Right. This is Mark Matts. Hell be auditioning for the role of George. (the guy looks very cool and casual and has a lot of hair) Hey how you doing? (thinking) Theyve gotta be kidding. (thinking) This guys perfect. O.K. Lets read this. Ill be reading Jerrys part. Anyone call for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find Mark funny) No. Why? Listen to me. I told the unemployment office I was close to a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So when you answer the phone now youve got to say: Vandelay Industries. Im Vandelay Industries? Right. What is that? Youre in latex. What do I do with latex? I dont know you manufacture it. This is Michael Barth. Another George. (hes in sweat pants bald with glasses) Hi Michael. How you doing? Everything all right? I just came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. Ive got a little gangrene theyre probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except George) Any questions? Yeah. What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser? No not a loser! Lets start with the second scene. You have it here? A man gave me a you know massage. (everyone laugh except George) So? Well he-- he had his hands you know and uh he was huh ... He was what? He was you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter) Thats a massage. I think it moved. This is Melissa Shannon. Hi. Hi. How you doing. Melissa is reading for Elaine. Its like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I uh made a faux pas. No you didnt. He knows hes bald. So how about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod George drops his notepad on the coffee table) O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down) (getting up) Uh you know what? Ill read with her. Oh great. Alright want to start? Yeah. O.K. Ahem. What was that look? What look? That look you just gave me? I gave a look? Yes. Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George) Lets see some more Kramers. Hi. How you doing? (to Jerry and very seriously) How you doing? (smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good. What is this about? (standing) Levels. Levels? Yeah. Im getting rid of all all my furniture. All of it! Im building... levels... with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt. I dont know how youre gonna be comfortable like that? Oh! Ill be comfortable. (laughter applause. He gets up goes to the coffee table) Very nice Very good Very nice Tom that was terrific. May I? (pointing the box of raisins) Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins) (to George) It was a wonderful reading. Yeah. Really. Well bye. Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director) Now I thought he was really good very funny. Yeah I liked him. What happened to the raisins? Yeah there was a box of raisins there! Did he just steal the raisins? You think he stole them? (enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand. (to Kramer) What are you doing here? You two know each other? Wait a minute I know you. Youre the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads. Thats true. (acting very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again but this time I went in. (pause stops acting) Oh! Uh wheres the bathroom? I think if you go down the hall its on the right at the very end. Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves) So whos playing Elaine? Oh dont worry about it. Very talented very takented young actress. Really? Yes. Who is it? Shes an eskimo actually. Oh my God (not in the mood to be kidding) She came down from Juno by sleigh she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line just kept going. Shes got the dogs with her in the hotel room. Listen was Russell at the casting? No he didnt show up. You know Im a little bit worried about him. I dont understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful? No. No youre not. Why do I keep setting you up? I dont know. (to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesnt listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over the service here is *really* slow. Yeah. Have you noticed anything else thats different since the new management? Mmm. Theyre putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that. Beside that. Look at the waitresses. Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts) What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them? Ah... I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldnt you say? Yes I would say. Whats going on here. How is that possible? Do you think its a coincidence? No. I havent seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film. (to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here? He does. (pointing to the manager Mr. Visaki) In fact were looking for another girl if you know anyone. (she walks away) You know what? Thats discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? Its not enough they get all the attention from men they have to get all the waitress jobs too? Hey thats life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You dont see any handsome homeless. You see Its right here. Its all white... Oh yeah. Yeah. Ive never seen this before. Youve never seen this before? Im gonna have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctors arm) (dramatically) A what? A biopsy. A biopsy? Yeah. Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer? Well I dont know what it is. A biopsy! What did he say? He said he didnt know what it was. Alright. So? When I asked him if it was cancer he didnt give me a get outta here. Thats what I wanted to hear: Cancer? Get outta here? Well maybe he doesnt have a get outta here kind of personality. How could you be a doctor and not say get outta here? It should be part of the training at medical school: Cancer? Get outta here! Go home! What are you crazy? Its a little test. Its nothing. Youre a real nut. You know that? (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never shouldve written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit well make millions of dollars and Ill be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip) Cant you at least die with a little dignity? No I cant. I cant die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesnt die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity? Hey. What happened to you yesterday? I got mugged. You got mugged? Mugged? Well I wouldnt have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom. Why didnt you use the bathroom in the building? It was full. I tried a few other places you know but that didnt work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and... Yeah? Its me. Come on up. But now I have a big problem buddy. What is it? Well I waited so long I-- I missed my chance. You didnt go? No. And now I cant get it back. The % thing to do is just not think about it. How could you not think about it? Hey. (mumbles and leaves) Whats the matter with him? Hes a little backed up. Oh... Elaine. So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop. Oh the sisters (he sits at the table) (to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life. So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself. Apply for a job? What for? Because its discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerrys shirts untucked) Its a coincidence. This is what you gonna wear? Yeah. Youre not gonna get the job. Exactly. (to the phone) Hello. Oh hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. Ill see you there. O.K. bye. (hangs up) Who was it? TV Elaine. She wants to get together and talk about the part. What about the dogs? Theyre having sex in the hotel room. So the Elaine character is based on someone you know. Yes. And shes really your ex-girlfriend? Uh Huh yeah. I want to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about her. Well shes fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals banlon and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window yet shes extremely dainty. How would she eat a hamburger? With her hands. What about pasta? Also with her hands. Seriously... I want to experience everything shes experienced. Everything? Everything. All right she cuts her pasta with a knife. Thats good. Whats her favorite movie? Shaft. You got to get me a picture. What about sex? She likes talking during sex. Oh... dirty talking? No. Just chitchat movies current events regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch) Elaine. What? Call me Elaine. All right. Elaine. How does Elaine kiss? Well-- Does she kiss... like this? (she kisses Jerry) Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around its like-- Like this? (kisses again but with the spiral) I think you got it. I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem. Ill have a hamburger. Thats it. Yeah thats good. Oh now I like to play golf. This stuff doesnt matter to me. See Im gonna do the character like me not like you. You gotta play him like me. Im Kramer. Im Kramer. Whoa Im Kramer. (foreign accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table. No Id like to apply for a waitress job. (looks Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before. Oh yeah. Ive been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. Ive worked all over the city. These uh are my references. Im sure youll find that Im more than qualified. I dont think I need anyone else right now. Youre in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital T. (she leaves) What? What did I do? Anyway theres at least four of them and theyre all huge. And one is bigger than the next. Its like a Russ Meyer movie. Whos Russ Meyer? Oh hes this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70s with these kinds of women. Hes obsessed. Hes obsessed with breasts. Thats hard to say. Anyway go on. Um... Well theres not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses and I went in to apply for the job. And he looked me up and down and he rejected me. (to a guy in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. I want you to listen to this. (to Elaine) Hi. Hi. Paul woman here claims theres a restaurant on the West side thats only hiring large-breasted women. (to Elaine) Really?]
63,4,24,[What do you mean made up? Its made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. Its not Danish. Youre crazy. No Im not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish? What do you mean Danish? (to the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael) Danish. Is it from Denmark? No they make it in New Jersey. Its just a Danishy name. I cant believe that. They fooled *me* Jerry. (to Jay) Boy talk about a show about nothing. (Jay the integral producer smiles stupidly) Uh excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guys in charge of yelling: take #!) This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see youre going: They fooled *me* Jerry! (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit fooled more: They *fooled* me Jerry!. You see the difference? Im not gonna say it like that. Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy) (with the same bothered face and while hes looking at George) All right everybody take a five. (very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. Thats five! George? (walks away to talk privately. George still casual taps on Jerrys shoulder) I dont have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather theyre a little touchy about being told how to say the lines. Why is that? I dont know but they dont seem to like it. By the way how am I doing? Oh youre fine... youre fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins? Why would he steal a box of raisins? Yeah its bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously) (to Jay about Russell) Whats with him? (to Russell) Russell? (louder) Russell? What? You O.K.? Yeah. No uh I was just thinking of something. Ill be back in a second. (he gets up and leaves) Whats the matter? Nothing. Youre acting weird. Is anything wrong? No. Are you breaking up with me? Are we going out? Youre breaking up with me arent you? (almost crying) Do you want me to break up with you? If thats what you want. I dont even know what youre talking about. Fine. Break up with me. All right. Were broken up. (little pause) Can we still be friends? (Jerry raises his head staring ahead and wondering whats going on) Remember when you came to audition for us? Yeah. There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you by any chance take them with you when left? What are you talking about? Well we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating some of the raisins. And then you left and the raisins were gone. And I was just wondering if you know (chuckles) maybe you took them with you. Are you accusing me of stealing the raisins? Oh no no-- (angry) Why would I steal a box of raisins!? No you wouldnt. Nobody would. Its just that... they were missing and... well Im just inquiring. (chuckles nervously) Let me give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. I dont wanna talk to you and I dont wanna hear anymore of your stupid little notes and suggestions. I dont like you. So if you got any other problems whether its raisins prunes figs or any other dried fruit just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way O.K.? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. I dont think were gonna have any problem with that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really. (nervously almost desperately) Elaine. Elaine. What do you want? What can I do? Is it my job? Is that what it is? Elaine I cant go on like this. Will you call me? Would you call me? Well why? All right. May I call you? Elaine? Elaine? (she hung up. An employee walks by bumps into Russell and spills coffee accidentally on him) Excuse me Mr. Dalrimple. I am so sorry. All right. All right. Whats your name? David Richardson. Get out! Youre fired! But Mr. Dalrimple-- Dont talk back to me. Didnt you hear what I say? Get out! You want me to call the cops? I make and break little worms like you every day. Do you know how much money I make? Do you have any idea! Do you know where I live? I can have any woman in this city that I want. Any one. Now GET OUT! (David leaves. Everyone on the set is looking at Russell) What are you all looking at? Go back to work! BACK! NOW! (they do Russell leaves) The doc called and said the labs backed up and now Im not gonna get the results for another two days. Ah! Youre fine. Theres nothing wrong with you. Im the one whos dying. What do you mean? Because I cant act! I stink! I dont what Im doing! Come on youre... uh... youre fine. This shows gonna ruin my entire career. I dont know how I got involved in this. What about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this things gonna be a success and Gods gonna give me a terminal disease. This actress playing Elaine shes out of her mind. The guy playing Kramer threatened me. Why? cause I asked him about the raisins. You mentioned the raisins. Oh yeah. Did he take em? I dont know. Well if he didnt take em what happened to em? Thats what Im trying to find out. Hey. Hey. Any luck? No. No nothing. I got no... peristalsis. What about bran? I tried bran-- 40% 50% 100%. The bran isnt working for me. Well my friend (Jerry puts his hand on Kramers shoulder) it may be time to consider the dreaded apparatus. Pfft! Hold it right there. If youre suggesting what I think youre suggesting youre wasting your time. I am not Jerry under any circumstances doing any inserting in that area. Oh its not that bad! Yes it is. Well its all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway. (to Elaine) So you going to the taping tomorrow night? No. I dont think I should go. I really dont wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He wont quit. Oh come on you gotta go! Hes harmless. Hes got a little crush on you. Jerry this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable. We need you there! (to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go? No. No. Im gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case theres any news from the front. (he leaves) (to her hairdresser) No! Pick it up more in the front! Its got to be higher! Higher! Make a wall! A wall! Sandi are you in wardrobe? Sandi? Try Elaine. Elaine? Yes? Elaine? Its me-- Wilton Marshall. Remember? Camp Tioga-- 1978? Remember? Oh right. Wow! You know you havent changed a bit. I cant remember my lines!!! Just relax youll be fine. I cant relax. I dont know what line! I dont know any of em! Youre just like George. Georged do the same thing. Youre just like him. Its amazing! Help me Jerry! Help me! (to Stu) Where is Russell? You know I dont know. I thought he was coming. I assumed he wouldnt miss it. He hasnt been well. (to Rita) Can I tell you something in confidence? I think its a woman. How pathetic. This is George Costanza Im calling for my test results. Negative? Oh my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh yes of course! How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up) (he walks casually to Tom and taps his arm) Listen. I know weve had our problems in the past but we got a show to do tonight. Time to pull together as a team. Lifes too short. I say lets let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins if you didnt take the raisins-- They werent even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room audition and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. Youll come in well talk about the raisins. Well have a nice laugh. How would you like it if I just pulled your heart out of your chest right now and shoved it down your throat? Are you ready to meet our cast? (crowd applause) All right. Good evening folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well you sound like a great crowd. We have a show were gonna put on for you tonight. Its a new TV show. Its what they call a pilot. And we hope it becomes a series. Its called Jerry and Im playing Jerry-- (getting up then shouting) SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS! (he jumps over a balcony and on the stage. The crowd is yelling) Sic semper tyrannis? What is that Latin? Yeah its what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln. Really? What does it mean? It means: Death to tyrants. I can see that. See now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already? No it starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping whats the big deal? Nah now its on TV. Its different. I told everybody I know to watch it. Yeah me too. Hey what about Russell? Did you hear from him? No. Strange. Even not showing up at the taping... Hey pistol-packin mama you swing that gal around Allemande left with the old gray hag around and around you go. Yee-ha!! Well well well. Congratulations. Well thank you. You went for the big E. Wet and wild. All right. Come on sit down. Its about to start. Oh yes. Hey whats this? Look. A wallet. A wallet? Let me see that. Here. Ah man! Its my fathers wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctors office that time. Shh! This is it! How do you like that? Bravo! You hurt me. Hey. Hey George. New sneakers? Yeah. What do you need new sneakers for? I like sneakers. How do you make a decision which one to wear? Id go crazy if I have to decide which sneakers to wear every day. Nah youre crazy anyway. (to each other while they recognize one of Georges behaviors in Michael) George! What kind of stupid show is this? Hey! Its that idiot that took all my records! (the houskeeper starts laughing) John what are you doing? Come back to bed. (with a Boston accent) This show looks interesting. Isnt he that Seinfeld fellow you went out with? Ooh hes horrible! Horrible! Nevertheless... Ah that Jerrys a funny guy. Huh? Got to love the Sein! Hate the Sein! (while she adjusts the tiny antenna) I cant believe you liked him. I thought he was dark and disturbed. Real perceptive. This is a piece of crap! Donald you used to like him. What a sellout! Give me that remote! No Donald. Come on Jerry the commercials almost over. All right. You know Jerry I really like this guy whos playing the butler. Oh yeah. Hes good. You know hes John Ritters cousin. Really? Yeah. Hello Charles. Hello. So where do you want me to start today? Why dont you start in the bedroom? (to himself upset) Start in the bedroom... Hey. Hey. The butlers here. He is? Listen. When hes finished send him over to my house. Im not sending him to your house. Why not? Because the judge decreed hed become my butler not my friends butler. Jerry he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. Thats what butlers do. But I dont want to. Jerry my house is a pigsty come on. Yeah? (from the buzzers speaker) Its Elaine. Come on up. I need more Pledge. More Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I dont even have any wood in the house! Well it goes fast. (to Charles very friendly) Hello. Hello. (he goes back in the bedroom) Whats all this about? We had a date. You had a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with my butler? Why do I need your permission? Because hes my butler! Thats terrific! How could anyone not like him? But he picks his nose. Hes a member of our health club. Isnt he? Yeah... You know that Kim Novak has some big breasts? Ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? You know I think when you name a baby Jeeves youve pretty much mapped out his future wouldnt you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman I think after that. (with a British accent) Terribly sorry Sir but Im going to have to whack you. (applauding and shaking hands) Wooh! Yeah! Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. Im not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly. Lets go out and celebrate! (they all get up) That was so good. Come on lets eat something. (phone rings) You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich! Do you really think so? Oh yeah. And God didnt kill me. (to the phone) Hello? Hi Jerry this is Rita Kierson. Oh hi Rita. Im calling to let you know that Russell Dalrimple is no longer with this network. Oh my God. Did he get fired? To be honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared. Russells disappeared? In any event Ive been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may not know Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many many projects. And as my first order of business Im uh passing on your show. Youre passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago! Well I just got the job. Goodbye Jerry. Yeah see ya. (he hangs up) What-- What are you looking at me for? It was you! What did I do? Do you realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series? I didnt know that hed fall for me and Id drive him insane. I mean you know thats not my fault. Yes it is! Youre very charming! I cant believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he? No one knows. She works for Pendant Publishing. Shes the most beautiful woman Ive ever seen. You know I used to work for NBC but when I go back to her this time shell respect me. Youd better get down. They might start firing soon. (harpoon fires) Hey look at this. What is going on here? Well well well. Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now youre eating here? Oh no. Thats why were here. Were checking things out. Yeah were checking it out. (to Paul) Youre checking it out? (to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office guys. Fred Paul lunch and dinner? Boy you guys ought to move in. How about a piece of pie on me? Sophia! Take care of these fellows. (to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this! Get away with what? Ah with what? You know what. With the waitresses. How theyre all... alike. Of course theyre alike. Theyre my daughters. (embarrassed but smiling) Oh your daughters. You must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir theyre lovely girls absolutely lovely girls. Its nice to see such fine upstanding women in gainful employment Mr. Visaki. Oh heres a table for you. A table right here. Peggy! Peggy! (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggys coming over to serve. What a family! My daughter Peggy. Ah! Peggy. Good to see you. Hi Peggy. Thank you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what I got do tomorrow? What? Start looking for a job. You know what you ought to do George? You should work for Greenpeace.

Theres one liiiittle problem. Sexual? Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... Ive never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect. Below the equator? Yeah. Nobody does. You know nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think theyre happy if you just make an effort. I-I dont know. Last time I got the tap. You got the tap? You know youre going along you think everythings all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know its like pfffff (whistling sound) all right thats enough youre through. The tap is tough. Its like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball. Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business. No no this wasnt moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that. Its a very complicated area. You can go crazy trying to figure that place out. Its a haaazy mystery. Anyway I think everything else is okay. Unless of course shes faking. Whos faking? Nothing. Faking what? Nobodys faking. Ah! Orgasm? Shes not faking! How do you know? I know. I can tell. Its one of my powers. Why did you ever fake? Of course. Really? You faked? On occasion. And the guy never knows? No. How can he not know that? Because I was gooood. I guess after that many beers hes probably a little groggy anyway. You didnt know. What? You didnt know. Are you saying... I think Ill have a piece of cake. With me? Well... You faked with me? Ye. You faked with me? Yeass. No. Yeass. You faked it? I faked it. That whole thing the whole production it was all an act? Not bad huh? What about the breathing the panting the moaning the screaming? (points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake fake fake fake. Im stunned Im shocked! How many times did you do this? Uuuhm all the time. All the time?! We got a chocolate malt in here! But Im so good. Im sure you are. Jerry listen it wasnt you. I just didnt have em back then. She faked. Maybe theyve all been faking. Im sure theyre not. Maybe Karen is faking. She was probably joking. No no it was no joke. She didnt have any? No. None. (raising hand) She faked em all. (raising hand) Faked em all. Well so she faked em so what? The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. Thats sexual perjury. You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times. How did she do it? Shes like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. Im not unskilled Im in the union. If shed at least told me maybe I could have done something about it. Yeah I could have helped you out. What could you have done? I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy. Im feeling very inadequate about the whole thing. Aaaaah. Dont aaaaah! Im supposed to do something with her later? I dont even think I wanna see her. Giddy-up. Hello... Oh hello Elaine. So were having dinner tonight? I dont know Im not really in the mood. Why? Whats wrong? Youre not still thinking about this afternoon are you? What the grilled cheese? Naaah they always burn the toast. Nooo the other thing. Oooh that. Well... Oh come on Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it. Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty? Okay. All right. All right see you later. Bye. Bye. Rene can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: Ummm have you ever... you know... faked it? Yeah sometimes. Really like when? Like if we went to a Broadway show if we had really good seats. (Elaine is sitting there jaw opened shaking her head yes) Well you know if its enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep. I really dont feel like seeing her. You know I faked it. (confused) What?! Yeah. You faked it? Why would you do that? Well you know if its enough already and I just wanna get some sleep. Yeah but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach? Its terrible! Did you get that at Joes? Yeah of course I got it at Joes. Thats surprising his fruit is usually the best. You know what Im gonna do? (heading for the door) Im gonna return this. Youre returning used fruit? Jerry this peach is sub par. So what do you want me to do? I want restitution. Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution? Because its no good. When you put that fruit out thats where it ends for me. Its still your fruit you gotta stand behind your fruit. I stand behind my fruit. So... Hey you got a bad peach? Thats an act of God. He makes the peaches. I dont make the peaches I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him. You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go. Well let me put a solution for ya: do your business elsewhere I dont want your business. Oh now you dont want my business. No I dont want your business and from this moment youre banned from the store youre banned! But what am I gonna do for fruit? (moaning) Mmmmm Mmmm Hmmhmmhmmm (lights a cigarette) Mmmm (takes a puff) Woo (thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied? Im very satisfied. I-Im sure if you werent satisfied you would probably say something wouldnt you? I probably would. But then again Im an enigma. Hey listen... umm instead of the movie... uh maybe well go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head) Maybe. So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... youre generally okay with everything in there? Generally. Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto? Well no I feel full after the Risotto. Yeah...(scratching his head) full. Oh god Mmmm Mmm Mmm Mmmmm Mmm Ah Woo Satisfied? Mmm hey you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie? Meryl Streep? You dont like her? Ah shes okay. I love her Jerry shes so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. Theres no acting there. Yeah. You dont want coffee or anything do you? I really admire actors you know. Its just such an incredible skill. Yeah yeah can we get off of this? Whats the matter? Nothing. Youre not still thinking about that are you? Nooo. Oh good. Give me another shot! (shocked) What? Another shot I want another shot. You mean...? Yes! Oooh no I dont think so. Come on! One shot I can do it I know I can do it! Jerry were friends! We cant do that it would ruin our friendship. Oh friendship... friendship shmanship . Jerry no thats important to me. We wont ruin the friendship. Ya Yes we will! Elaine... No Jerry it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship it kills it. A half hour give me a half our. No! Okay fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes I can make it happen! Noo! Youre worried Ill be able to do it arent you? What no it doesnt matter. Jerry I dont care. Thats it thats it. You like having this over me you dont want me to do it. That is so ridiculous. Come on Elaine! No. Elaine?! No! Its Jerrys fault. Jerry? Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts. Oh I dont care George really its all right. So you feel okay? Well its not like after the Risotto. Well good night. I still dont understand why we had to walk out on that movie. Oh that Meryl Streep shes such a phony baloney. Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic). Oh what youre upset? Yes Im upset cant you tell? No I cant maybe youre faking. Im really really sorry I told you that. Im sorry too. Well stop being such a baby. Youre a baby! Youre a baby! Its all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm she didnt have an orgasm. Orgasm this orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom I lost it. I tried everything I was talking to him: Please wake up do something. Theyre mysterious little fellows arent they? I hate him! You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens. Its like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation. Hey. Hey. Hey listen if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit? Why cant you get it? Well I got banned from the store I cant go back in there now. What happened? Well you know we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesnt want my business. Hey was that a joke about Houdini?

I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. Ive known it ever since I was a little kid. Ive been waiting for it. This mango is delicious!

The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick dont you think? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You dont think I bought all that?

Because I said so. (pushes George off the bed) I-I-I cant find my glasses. Well hurry up. I need to look for my glasses. (seen through George eyes all blurry) Get out! Get out!! Get out!!! Its all Georges fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. Its a lot of pressure! You know Im a little hungry. You wouldnt happen to have any of that mango left?]
65,5,2,[I cant believe this. Oh it wont be for that long. How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please tell me. Theyre insane. You know that. Hey my parents are just as crazy as your parents. How can you compare you parents to my parents?! My father has never thrown anything out. Ever! My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers! My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water. (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle not a chuckle not a tee-hee.. never went Ha! A smirk? Maybe!.. And Im moving back in there! I told you Id lend you the money for the rent. No no no no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship. Alright. Im ready. (To George) You know I still dont understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents? I dont want to! Im outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank. Well move in here. (Stopping the notion) Whats that? Why doesnt he just move in here? (Sarcastic) Yeah yeah. Im gonna move in with him. He doesnt even let you use the toilet! You can move in with me if you want. (Sincerely) Thank you.. I uh.. that might not work out. Careful! Careful with the suitcases! We just painted! Hello Mrs. Costanza. (quietly) Hello Mrs. Costanza. (not really noticing Jerry said Hello) Hello Kramer. Close the door. Well I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door) More stuff?! Yeah. (Exits) (To George) How much is there?! (Annoyed) Theres more. So how are ya Jerry? Fine Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey I got a terrific joke for you.. (Sits down on the couch) Nah not interested. No no. It-Its really funny. Theres these two guys- (Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives Jerry an I told you so look) Here (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) I made some bologna sandwiches. Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore! What are you talking about?! (to Jerry) Have a sandwich. (setting down a box) No thanks. Oh stop it! You dont want one Kramer? Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door) I think youre all a little touched in the head. (Puts the plate down) Youre so worried about your health.. Youre young men. I really dont eat it. What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you take them home? Give them to someone in your building? I dont know if Id feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.. (Enters with a box) Alright thats it. Anything else? (Muttering) No thats it. Oh I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves) Well I guess well be going.. (Heads for the door) (Runs over to him not wanting him to leave) What? Youre going? Yeah. Wha - what are you doing later? Oh Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend. Really? Yeah You cant believe this woman. Shes one of those low-talkers. You cant hear a word shes saying! Youre always going excuse me? what was that? Yeah.. may - maybe Ill meet ya? No George. Were going out to eat tonight with your father. (Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later. Yeah take it easy. (Leaves) Oh my God.. (Buries his face into his hands) Okay well he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs) Right. You remember that? Yeah well that was a good one. Well.. Whats that? Excuse me? Yeah.. yeah. Yep. Yeah.. You know that uh Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? Shes a designer. (Interested) Oh? In fact shes come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in mens fashion.. Its a a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well yeah it - its all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear. Oh a puffy shirt. Puffy. Yeah see I think people want to look like pirates. You know its the right time for it.. to be all puffy and devil-may-care.. (Still laughing) Thats true.. (Gets up) Ill be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes) Uh o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerrys going to be on the Today show on Friday. Yeah thats right! Yep.. yep. Um hes promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill you know they uh they clothe the (clears her throat) poor and the homeless.. (Points at Elaine) And the indigent. And the indigent yeah.. I I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up and I got Jerry to do it. Sure. Ohh yeah. Yeah.. yep. Uh-huh. Yep. Yep.. Mmm Maybe you should take a civil service test. (Studying the salt shaker) Im not taking a civil service test. Look at this George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You ever seen a silver dollar? Yes Ive seen a silver dollar. Why dont you want to take a civil service test? To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do? Would you believe when I was 18 I had a ssssilver dollar collection? I dont understand. You get job security - you get a pay check every week.. Im a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman? (Still looking at his coin) You know I couldnt bring myself to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia. So what are you gonna do?! I dont know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just dont know what it is yet! I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today. (does a form of magic trick making the coin disappear as he shows George an empty hand) (Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God.. I dont like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. he doesnt want to come over. (Needing to get away from his parents he gets up) I need some air.. George where are you going?! (Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do. Oh Im sorry. Im terribly sorry.. (Bends down and starts picking up her things) Look at what youve done! You spilled my bag! (Stuttering) I I I .. here let me - let me help you.. No no no. Its all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up) It - its just that Im here with my parents and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth I dont even think Id pass it.. So.. Hmm.. What? (Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands. What about them? Theyre quite exquisite! They are? (Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling? Hand modeling? (Shakes his head No) (Fishes a card out of her purse then hands it to George) Heres my card. Why dont you uh give me a call? (Walks off) (Shrugs) I - I dont get it. Me neither! What is it? I dont know. Theyre hands! This woman just set me up for a job! (Gets up and displays his own hands) Well what about my hands? I dont see how your hands are any better than my hands. What are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerrys hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand) Well thats what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life. This is it! It happened to me Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant the two nut jobs were talking - I couldnt take it any more. I got up and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman.. Its just like in the movies. Hey. (Hes carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerrys coat hooks) Hey. Hey George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs) OH!!!! What are you crazy?! Are you crazy?! What?! You coulda damaged my hand! (Laughing) But its only a toy! (Explaining) George has become a hand model. A hand model? Yes. (To George) Really? Let me see your hands. (Defensively) You can look at them but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out) Lets see.. (studies them) oh those are nice. You know Ive never noticed this before? Theyre smooth.. creamy.. delicate yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine. (Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright (puts them on) I gotta get going. Oven mitts? (Embarrassed) Thats all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door? Yeah.. Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George) Thank you very much. (Walks out) Youre not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show shes been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.. Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said he looks up) Since I said what? Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover) What are you talking about? When you said that youd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover) (Goes up to it) This? Yea. I agreed to wear this?! Yeah yeah. But when did I do that? When we went to dinner the other night. What are you crazy?! What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom? I dont know! I couldnt understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding! (makes his pop sound) There you go. Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV and I said Yes?! Yes yes! You said it! But I - I didnt know what she was talking about. I couldnt hear her! (Takes it off the hook and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well she asked you. I - I cant wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean look at it! It looks ridiculous! Well you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that youre gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin em. Theyre making these? Yes yes. This pirate trend that shes come up with Jerry this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90s. Youre gonna be the first pirate! (Like a little kid) But I dont want to be a pirate! I knew it. I knew it.. I always knew you always had beautiful hands. I used to tell people. Frank didnt I use to talk about his hands? (Looking up from his paper) Who the hell didya ever mention his hands to? (Getting annoyed) I mentioned his hands to plenty of people! You never mentioned them to me! (Snaps then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board. I always talk about your hands - how theyre so soft and milky white.. No! You never said milky white! (Getting angry) I said milky white! (To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Dont hand them to me with the point facing out! Im sorry. Youre sorry?! (Apologizing) Ill try to be more careful. (Stern angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors) Georgie.. (Nudges Georges arm disrupting his work with the scissors) Oh Georgie would you like some Jell-O? (To Estelle referring to the Jell-O) Whyd you put the bananas in there?! (Yelling) George likes the bananas! (Trying to match her tone) So let him have bananas on the side! Alright! Please please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape so please - keep the television down and the conversation to a minimum. (Meek) But Georgie.. what about the Jell-O? (Definite) Ill take it in my room. (Walks off) Yeah come in. I just wanted to let you know hes got about five minutes. Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes! Now thats a great looking shirt! (Gets up admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! Im glad I ironed it. Its perfect. (Walks around Jerry inspecting the shirt) Look at it! Its fantastic! (Resisting) Kramer how am I gonna wear this?! I-I cant wear this! (Reassuring) Hey this looks better than anything you own. You know in two months time everybodys gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look! Yeah. Hi Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel he said he might help out at the benefit! Great. (Between laughs) What is that?! Its the puffy shirt. Look at it eh? Whatdya think? Is it cool or what? (To Jerry) Whyre you wearing that now? (Obviously mad at the situation hes in) Why am I wearing is now?? Ill tell you why Im wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to thats why! And I said yes. Do you know why? Because I couldnt HEAR her! When did she (Snickers) when did she ask you this? When we were at dinner when Kramer went to the bathroom. I didnt hear anything. (Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks! (Just now making the matter serious) Well you cant wear that on the show. (To Elaine muffled low and threatening) Elaine you want to stop? (Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You cant come out dressed like that! Youre all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo! (Arms out complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. theyre producing them as we speak! (Arguing) Yeah but youre supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like youre gonna.. swing in on a chandelier! (Looking down at a clipboard enters) Okay lets go. (Looks up points at Jerrys puffy shirt) Is that what youre wearing? Ive never seen hands like these before.. Theyre so soft and milky white. You know whos hands they remind me of? (Pauses for effect) Ray McKigney. Ugh.. Ray. He was it. Who was he? The most exquisite hands youve ever seen.. Oh he had it all. (Hands still out even though theyve stopped looking at them) What happened to him? (Clears throat) Tragic story Im afraid. He couldve had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love.. You mean uh..? Yes. he was not.. master of his domain. (Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..? (Quick to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadnt seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigneys until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control. (Smiling to himself) You dont have to worry about me. (Nodding gloating) I won a contest. Ok lets get to work. (Talking directly to the camera) Back now 7:46. On Tuesday the 19th here in New York there will be a benefit for the Goodwill Industries - a used clothing organization that provides services to the needy. One of the performers will be comedian Jerry Seinfeld. (Turns to face Jerry) Jerry good morning. (Mumbling out) Thank you Bryant. (Pointing out) And speaking of clothing that is a very very unusual shirt you have on. (Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh thank you. Youre all kinda (Waves his hands around) kinda puffed up. (Chuckles) Yeah its a puffy shirt. (Laughing) You look kinda like a pirate. (Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway ah you know were hoping to um raise enough money.. with this.. uh.. (Rudely interrupting still snickering at the shirt) You.. ah look Im sorry it is just a VERY unusual shirt. It could be kind of a whole new look for you.. you know you could put a patch over an eye you could be kind of like the pirate-comedian. Uh-huh yeah. (Smiling nodding clearly wanting Bryant to shut up) Are you going to be wearing the shirt at the concert? (Losing it mad) Look its not my shirt. (Confused) Whose shirt is it? Whats the difference? I agreed to wear it. Its - its a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it and I think its the stupidest shirt Ive ever seen to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding) (Off camera shrill high pitched yelling) You bastard! (To Jerry) Did you hear that? (Pointing off screen nodding) THAT I heard. (Instructing George) Alright a little to the left.. Little higher little higher. Good. Perfect! Perfect. Like that? Just like that. Hold it. (Takes picture) Good ok let me get just one more one more. (Takes another picture) Good thats it. Youre done. Thats it? (Smiling) Thats it. (Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And heres your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor. It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful. (Modest) Oh thank you very much. (Chuckles) You know I was wondering - if youre not doing anything later maybe youd like to get together..? You ruined me! You ruined my career! Oh just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you. (Shouting out) Oh I dont give a damn! (Reasoning) You know if you talked this loud to begin with I wouldnt be in this costume in the first place! (Quick excited talking) Hey hey! You cant believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands theyd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! Im busting. Jerry Im busting! Hey Ive never noticed your hands before. Let me see. Alright. (Holds them up) (Obviously not impressed dull) Yeah real nice. (Turning back to Jerry he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerrys wearing and snickers pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show? Yeah. What have you completely lost your mind? (Faint trying to shut George up) Hey.. Whos dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know I wouldnt wipe my- (Unable to take anymore Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building on the street and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling) You ready? Ow! Hot! Hot! (Sincere) Im sorry. (Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron? Well I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt. My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking bitter tone) puffy shirt. (Pointing out) It didnt do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for: Avast ye matey - what the hell does that mean?! 20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon! - theres no comeback for that! (Reflecting) Well it got me fired from the benefit committee. You know all those stores canceled out on her? Shes finished. (Concluding) Were (Leslie and him) finished. Really? What happened? (Showing pure irony) I just cant be with someone whos life is in complete disarray. What happened with all the shirts? They gave them all to Goodwill. Ahh can you spare a little change for an old buccaneer? (While digging in his pocket for some money he looks over the shirts one last time) You know its really not a bad looking shirt..]
66,5,3,[Do you ever spit on anybody from here? No. You? No. Do you ever think about it? Yeah. Me too. Hey. Hey. Well I got it! You got me the air conditioner? What do you think? Beautiful! What air conditioner? Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off. Is it a good one? Good one? Its the Commando 8. Commando 8? 12000 BTUs. I thought you hated air conditioning. Youve never had an air conditioner. Yeah but Amy likes air conditioning. Oooh youre getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice:) Amy doesnt like the temperature up here. Shes a little hoooot. All right. Okay so Im gonna measure the window up okay buddy? Yeah. Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah rock on! I gotta get out of this city. So youre tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently) Im at the health club and while Im in the pool some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses? You dont have an old pair? I broke em playing basketball. He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs) Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these. George those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool? Theres a lot of change down there. When I find that guy this much I vow: those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner. Were behind you Aquaboy. Godspeed! What kind of a sick demented person wants another persons glasses? Yeah especially those frames. You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. Hell give you thirty percent off. Yeah come on. Hey he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner. Really? Retail is for suckers. Wow. Uh what do I have to do? You just gotta mention my name. Thats it? Thats it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler) What about these? They look good. I liked the other one too. Ive liked about five of them. Well its a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. Im deciding on a new face. (bored) Come on George. Pick a face and go with it. Now those look good theyre very bold. Yes they are bold. Jerry what do you think? (While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they werent wearing glasses. Hi there little doggy. (to owner:) Do you mind if I pet your dog? Its okay with me. Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah! Hey you cant have that dog in here. Are you okay? Did he bite ya? Can you believe that guy? Im okay its just a nip. He just walked away! And once again Im standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man! My leg looks pretty bad. Oh Im gonna take you over to the emergency room. Okay. (To George:) Hey any luck? Did you catch em? Uuh no no. All right Im gonna take Elaine over to the hospital. (In a really strange way) Good good do that. Whats the matter? Oh no nothing. What is it? I cant tell you. (pulling on Jerrys pants from the ground) Jerry can we go? Yeah yeah in a second in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean you cant tell me? I cant tell you dont ask. Im asking! Jerry my leg. Yeah yeah take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on George what is it? I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey. What? They were right outside! Amy and Jeffrey? Yes! Are you sure? Yes positive. But you cant see theres no lenses in those frames. I know! I was squinting. Okay listen Jerry you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood. Were gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi! (To the store owner:) Excuse me what do you think of these? Oh we just got those in. Its a very exciting new frame. Yes it is exciting! All right this is gonna be my new face. All right do you have a prescription? Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer... What? Kramer... What about him? You do know Kramer? Yes... Well Im mentioning his name. Why? Because... you know... No I dont know. Look Im gonna need a deposit on these. Oh come on. Cousin Jeffrey? Its not possible! Why not? They could have met. She loves the park he works for the Parks Department. Jerry that is so ridiculous. But George didnt even have his glasses on! But he was squinting. So what? Squinting doesnt make that much of a difference. Are you kidding? Ive seen em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons on the road! Okay. Okay? Thats it? I dont need a shot? Not shot dog bite. No no no. I know I wasnt shot. Do I need a shot? Not shot dog bite. Woof woof not bang bang. Nah look at this. Cables out. Oh thats okay we dont have to watch tv. No no no. No trouble at all its a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know whats going on. That theyre not... getting away with anything. Oh Im on hold. So what did you do yesterday? Yesterday? Yeah you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out. I didnt do anything. (laughing) Oh you must have done something. No nothing really. Didnt go out of the house? Didnt take a walk... on Columbus Avenue? Well I did go out for a little while. Well your days getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah see told me theyd be back in a minute and THEY lied. You cant thrust anyone. No you cant. (hangs up the phone) Now lets cut the ball sister! You think I dont know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue? What are you talking about? Look my friend saw you. Saw me? With who? You tell me. Theres nothing to tell. There isnt? No. Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza? I had a feeling this was to good to be true. Why? I knew there had to be another side to you. No no theres no side!

She hadnt seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side. What side? A bad side an ugly side. Ooh so what? So what? I wasnt planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve. Why dont you just ask Jeffrey? Ah hed just deny it. There must be some way to find out. Amy said nothing happened.

Hey Dwayny. Oh hello Kramer. What is going on here? What are you talking about? Im talking about the thirty percent discount. Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...

You can look for sneakers the next day! He doesnt know anything about bras. I know a little. Besides what do you have to know? Well it wouldnt hurt to go in the and be able to discuss it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? (to Estelle) Where is you bra? Give him a bra to look. I am not giving him a bra. Why not? Because I dont need him looking at my bra. Why so hell go to the interview and he wouldnt know what hes talking about!?! Do we have to...?

All right a guess thats about it. I got it. Cups in the front loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table) You got ketchup on it! Sniffing what do you mean sniffing? Sniffing with his nose. Jerry he probably had a cold. No I asked him. So what are you saying? I dont know you know what if...? Drugs? You think hes on drugs? I dont know. Jerry All I know he was sniffing. Listen we went in on a CD together. I know. And Newman gave you money too. So I didnt even meet this guy. You know we trusted you. Look it doesnt necessarily mean anything yet it just means he was sniffing. Well what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word man? No he didnt use man. I mean when he was leaving did he say Im splittin? No but in one point he did use the bathroom. Whoh! Do you think thats a bad sign? Yes!! Yes thats what they do! They live in the bathroom!

In the drawer on the right. Hmm... What? Nah its nothing. What is it? Its nothing. Tell me. Well I was just curious why you didnt use an exclamation point? What are you talking about? See right here you wrote Myra had the baby but you didnt use an exclamation point. So? So its ya nothing. Forget it forget it I just find it curious. Whats so curious about it? Well I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it I would use an exclamation point. Well maybe I dont use my exclamation points as haphazardly as you do. You dont think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point. Hey look I just chalked down the message. I didnt know I was required to capture the mood of each caller. I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby. Ok Im excited. I just dont happen to like exclamation points. Well you know Jake you should learn to use them. Like the way Im talking right now I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one! Well you can put one on this one: Im leaving! Youre out of your mind you know that. Why? Its an exclamation point! Its a line with a dot under it. Well I felt a call for one. A call for one you know I thought Ive heard everything. Ive never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation. I found it very troubling that he didnt use one. George was right. Didnt take you long. Anything new with that guy on drugs? Oh hes not on drugs. Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff sniff) sniffing? All right here you call him right now. See if hes sniffing right now. Good idea. (Jerry calls Barrys office) Prophet and Goldstein. Yes Id like to speak to Barry Prophet please. Im sorry hes out of town this week. Out of town? Yes he went to South America. South America? South America? Ill call back thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America! Yyyeeaaah!! So what? Who goes to South America? People go to South America. Yeah and they come back with things taped to theyre large intestine. So because of a few bad apples youre gonna impugn an entire continent? Yes Im impugning a continent. Well I say were going to take our money right now! Hey hey... Hello Newman. Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) So any news? Yeah he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America! South America?! (to Jerry) What kind of snow blower you get us mixed up with? Look it gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay. Wait there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. Ohh what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on... Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out... If we put our three heads together we should come up with something. Whats today? Its Thursday. Really? Feels like Tuesday. Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel Friday has a feel Sunday has a feel.... I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... All right shut up the both of you! Youre making me nervous. Where is he already? He shouldve been out of work by now. Hey you know this is kind of fun. Yeah maybe we oughta become private detectives... Yeah maybe you should. Maybe I will. Yeah me too. All right what are you gonna say to him? Just gonna find out if hes interested. Hey hey maybe I should go with him? No you stay here in the car. Who made you the leader?

Oh theres nothing like a cold one after a long day eh? Yeah. Oh yeah Ive been known to drink a beer or two. But then again Ive been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette? (sniffs) No I never touch them. I suckem down like Coca-Cola. Well heres to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like youve got yourself a little cold there eh fella? I dont think so. Me neither. You should try this new dental floss Glide its fantastic. I use dental tape. You should try this. I dont wanna. Not even once? No. Youre an idiot. Why because I use dental tape? Right anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot. South America? Yeah yeah. Well thats a burgeoning continent. Well they are expanding their economic base. Tell me about it. (sniffs) Excuse me I gotta goto the bathroom. Im hip. Hip to the what? To the whole scene. (sniff) What scene? The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed) Listen dont take this personally but when Im coming back Im sitting over there. What ever turns you on. No no I dont like it. What do you mean you dont like it? How could you not like it? I like the thick tape. Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you? So basically George the job here is quite simple. Selling bras. Well that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed sir. Have you ever sold a womans line before? No but um I have very good report with women very good comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres I was enthralled. Hum. tell me about it. Well I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mothers brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up studied it. I thought I like this. I didnt know what way or what level but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres. Thats an incredible story. You have a remarkable passion for brassieres. Well theyre more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front two loops in the back. How do they do it? Well I think I can say barring some unforeseen incident that you will have a very bright future here at E.D. Granmont. Thank you Mr.Farkus thank you very much indeed sir. See you monday 9 oclock. If you dont mind sir. Ill be here at 8. Excellent. So long Mr. Farkus. What youre think youre doing? Oh nothing... Farkus get out here! Yes Ms. De Granmont? Farkus who is this pervert little weasel? Uh this is Costanza hes our new bra salesman. (Georges offers his hand to shake) Hes supposed to start on monday. If hes here on monday youre not. Take a pick. (to George): Get out! (to Ms. De Granmont) Im terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont... You wanted to see me Mr. Lippman? I was just uh going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand you worked with him very closely on this. Yes (clears her throat) yes I did. And uh anyway I was just reading your final edit and um there seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points. Uh well um I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity. Ah (reads an excerpt) It was damp and chilly afternoon so I decided to put on my sweatshirt! Right well... You put exclamation point after sweatshirt? Thats thats correct I-I felt that the character doesnt like to be ch-ch-chilly... I see (reads another excerpt) I pulled the lever on the machine but the Clark bar didnt come out! Exclamation point? Well yeah you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out... Get rid of the exclamation points... Ok ok ok ... I hate exclamation points... ...ok Ill just.... Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately. Exclamation point. You still have no proof. Elaine he was sniffing like crazy around me. I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th. Double exclamation point! Will that take care of ours too? Yeah Ill give you yours as soon as I get my money back. Hey you want me to mail it? Im on my way out anyway. Yeah thanks. Itll be my pleasure. Seeya later. You know this... Hey Ralph. Hi Ralph.

What is it made out of? I dont know Jerry gave it to me. Mohair I think. Mohair that figures Im allergic to mohair. You mean you just started sniffing? Yeah mohair does it to me every time. I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in. Jerry I was wearing it in the bar. The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See I told you he wasnt a drug addict. Oh no! The letter Newman its got exclamation points all over it! Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet. The what?? After you. Thank you. Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny! What do you mean you felt the material? What with your fingers like this? So what what is so bad about that? Who goes around feeling peoples material? What can be gained by feeling a persons material? Its insanity! What ever happened to Why thats a lovely dress you have on. May I have this dance?!! You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter. Sorry Im late I just came from a meeting with my lawyer. What is this? Its a letter from your friend Barry Prophets lawyer. He is filing a chapter eleven. Why whats going on why is he filing a chapter eleven? Bankruptcy bankruptcy...as in Ive taken your money and spent it on drugs! What do you mean I thought it was the sweater. All right What about the money? What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven Ive couldve got the money back. Which I wouldve done if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!! Pair of bear claws please. Nice. Think so? Yeah what is it? Half silk half cotton half linen. How can you go wrong?]
68,5,5,[...And then babys head comes out and Im screaming and my brother whos been videotaping the whole thing turns green his eyes roll up in his head and he blacks out he drops the camera the camera breaks and then the placenta comes flying out. Whoa. And then doctor says... (interrupting) Thanks thats enough. Will you look at that kid. Sucking away. Sucking like theres no tomorrow. Suck suck suck... (Looking away) Yeah yeah yeah.

(ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friends wifes breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable? Look at him. So how long do they do this? Jus a year or two. No break? After that comes the weaning. So after the sucking comes the weaning. First the sucking then the weaning. Well you gotta wean. Gotta wean. Must wean. What about that spot I got? Yeah I saw the spot. You open the door to the car boom you walk right into the hospital. Eh You cant beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. Im just willing these great parking spots. George... Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself. (to Elaine) Wheres Kramer? Shouldnt he be here by now. Did you give him the room number? Ya 1397. 1937 1937 1937... Excuse me. Do you know where the elevator is? Uh ya its right around the corner there. 1937. Oh! God Its a Pig man! A pig man! ..So anyway Jerry Elaine we have something we want to ask you. You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me. Will you shut up George. Im taking a cab home. I cant this anymore. You were saying Stan? I-Im sorry about that. Myra and I would like you and Elaine to be the Godparents of Steven. Huuh Wow. Me? Godfather? Yes. (a la Don Corleone) Never go against the family Elaine. What? Hey I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound this (Quells like a pig). Kramer what the hell are you talking about? Im talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was. A pig-man? A pig-man. Half pig half man! Thats great Kramer... So-So anyway tell us whats involved in being a Godparent. (a la Don Corleione) Elaine never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) Godfather. The most important thing is you help with the bris. The bris? A bris? You mean circumcision? Ya. I would advise against that. Wha Kramer. Its a tradition. Ya well so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods but we dont do that anymore. Well maybe we should. (knocks on the window) Hey why are all those people milling around my car? I dont know. Maybe theyre admiring your spot. Theyre all looking up. Hey theres a guy up the roof. Whoa. Thats the guy that I told where the elevator was. Oh well I hope he doesnt jum... Oh my! My car! My caaaaarrrr! A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel? A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision. Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES MUTTERING) Motels models... How do you find a Mohel? Oh finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. Thats a tough job. How would you like that? Hey Jerry you ever seen one? You mean that wasnt uh. Yeah. No.. you? Ya. Whatd you think? (shakes her head) No had no face no personality. It was like a martian. But hey you know thats me. Hey. Well I just got the estimate. Its going to cost more to fix that roof than the cars worth So Im going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and its not gonna be me. Ah youre screwed. I know swan dives from twenty floors up lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldnt move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. Its city property. Well I have to interview a Mohel. How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels. YEA! Whats the matter? Are you alright? Dont even question my instincts because my instincts are honed. (RE:PAPER) Look at that. What now? Look look. (Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research.. Government funds genetic research at area hospital ... Yeah so? pig-man baby. pig-man. If I hear about this pig-man one more time... Hey Im tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties. Oh will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesnt mean theyre creating a race of mutant pig-men! Jerry wake up to reality. Its a military thing. Theyre probably creating a whole army of pig warriors. I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly Im looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say Hey hes no pig-man! Believe me thered be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is theres always some group of perverts thats attracted to it. Oo that little tail really turns me on. (MUMBLES) Thats just about enough Oh whats the matter this doesnt interest you? Oh no its fascinating but could you do me a favor could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and Ill listen to it the next time Im here. Ive gotta go find a Mohel. You know you should call this off Elaine. Its a barbaric ritual. Well perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then off with their heads. But Kramer isnt it a question of hygiene? Its a myth. Besides it makes sex more pleasurable. Yeah. So how does that help me? (TO GEORGE) Hey George you ever see one? Yeah my roommate in college. So whatd you think? (thinks for a second) I got used to it. Alright Im waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man. Oh dont worry. Im gonna show you and youll never be the same. Maybe hes just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this theyre not necessarily pig-men. Believe me Jerry somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pig-man cries out for help. Well if I hear an anguished oink Im outta here. I-I dont see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human human human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer) What?! Oh its George. Alright the administrators on the third floor. Ill meet you guys back at the car. Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh? The pig-man can take the bus. George if the pig-man had a car he would give you a ride. How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater? Be realistic George. Ill tell you what if pig-man shows up well squeeze him in. Ill see you later. Yea. Mr. Costanza come in come in. Its been a very trying couple of days around the hospital. Doctors patients everyone just grief stricken over this unfortunate occurrence. Well I join them in their grief. Horrible thing. Flew right past the childrens wing. All the sick children in the playroom looking out the window just traumatized by the incident. Apparently they thought he was flying. You know how children are Oh look. A man is flying. A man is flying And then splat... Thats where I come in. Umm on splat. Uh you see Mrs. Sweedler or is it hospital administrator Sweedler? Mrs. Sweedlers fine. Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see this tragedy affected me in a very very personal way. How is that? Yes well you see the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat as it were actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I cant help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but Ive never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible what with the baldness and everything. Well I have known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat. Yes but then everything is all pulled down and its jus.. Anyway. The damage unfortunately has marred an otherwise fine automobile rendering it virtually undriveable. (STIFFENING) Yes well that is a shame. Yes a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler with all due discretion and sensitivity and taking in the whole scope of the situation I just cant help but think that the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other still living victim of horrendous horrendous tragedy. Mr.Constanza. Yes. A man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise - Yes. ... and you greedily callously want to profit from it? (PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well profit. I think youll see from the estimate that Im not really profiting that much. They might be a little high but.. Get out! Get out now! Get out of my office. Should I leave this..? GET OUT! Excuse me. What happened to the man that was in this room before? I dont know what youre talking about. You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB). No. (STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesnt look familiar to you? Uh Sir? Look I know whats going on. The oink oink. Yes well if youll excuse me. I really have some patients I have to attend to. (TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack There was a half man half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?! Half-what? You know what I mean - pork sausage (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-thats all folks. I think hes been released. Hes lying. Alright Kramer enough of this. Lets go find George. Alright you go ahead. Kramer. Wheres the Mohel? Hell be here. Hes late already. Relax. Youd think you were getting whacked. I dont know why he asked me to be the Godfather. Were not even that close of friends. Just cause were on the softball team Im the pitcher hes the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship? I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport. Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but Im just lobbing it in. We dont have any conferences. He doesnt come out to the mound and encourage me. What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands. Dont they have any closer friends. Theyre level jumping on our friendship. Yes it is level jumping. So uh... been to a bris before? No. Ive been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later which is quite common stay close to me. Ill get you through it. (chuckles) Im a cardiologist. I think Ill manage. Oh. Were not talking about a manicure. Imagine this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch. (Seeing Myra run away sobbing) Myra? Kramer whats the matter with you? Me? (to everyone) Oh thats the Mohel. (ADLIB) Its the Mohel! the Mohel is here! Thank God the Mohel is here. Hello. (to Elaine) Hello Hello (shaking hands with Jerry) Hello Im the Mohel. Hello. (contd) (shakes Stans hand) Its very nice to meet you all... (A PAN CLANGS TO THE GROUND. THE MOHEL SNAPS.) Oh! What was that?!? Jeez. Scared the hell out of me. My god. I almost had a heart attack! (THE CROWD GROWS UNEASY) (CALMING DOWN) Ok Im fine Im fine. Anyway were here to perform the mitzvah of the bris... (The Baby starts crying) (WITH INCREASING TENSION) ...Is the baby gonna cry like that? Is that how the baby cries with the loud sustained squealing cry cause that could pose a problem. Do you have any control of your child cause this will be the time to exercise it when baby is crying in that high-pitched squealing tone that can drive you insane!!! Did you find the place alright? Did I find it alright? Could you send me to a more dangerous neighborhood? Im dreading walking back to the subway someone shouldnt crack me over the head and steal my bag Because Ill be lying there and people will spit on me and empty my pockets. Ill be lying in the gutter like a bum like a dog like a mutt like a mongrel like an animal! God forbid anybody should help me or call an ambulance. Oh no thats too much trouble to pick up a phone and press a few buttons. Ahh! Whats the point. (setting down her glass) Oh ya haha. (TO ELAINE INTERRUPTING) Darling you see where that glass is? How that glass is near the edge of the table. You got the whole table there to put the glass why you chose the absolute edge so half the glass is hanging off the table you breath and that glass falls over then youre gonna have broken glass on the carpet embedded in the carpet fibers deep deep in the shag broken glass bits of broken glass that you never get out. you cant get it out with a vacuum cleaner. Even on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass you cant get all the pieces and then you think you got it all and two years later youre walkin barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself is that what you want? I dont think you want that is it? .. Do ya? Huh? (to Myra) Hes very highly recommended. So... (to George) Youre holding the baby? (getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohels way) No No. Hello! Whos holding the baby?!? Whos holding the baby? (uncertain) Yeah. Im holding the baby. (pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok go. Im going. Go. Im going. Cmon Dont push me. Okay. you sit here. Now I need the baby. Bring me the baby. I need the baby! No Im not going to let this happen. (numerous voices) Kramer! Let go of the baby! Kramer! People compose yourselves. (Shouting as the struggle ends) This is a bris. We are performing a bris here not a burlesque show. This is not a school play! This is not a baggy pants farce! This is a bris. An sacred ancient ceremony symbolizing the covenant between God and Abraham... or something. (The Mohel opens his bag to start the process but drops it and his instruments fall out. People attempt to help him out) No! Dont touch it! Dont touch a thing! Ok. (muttering to Jerry).. I coulda been a kosher butcher like my brother. The moneys good. Theres a union with benefits. And cows have no families. You make a mistake with a cow you move on with your life... Anyway. Hurry up George! Step on it! Alright alright! That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger! You flinched. Flinched? I did not flinch. George did I flinch? Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted. It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then everything went black. Whos got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. Its my phone finger! Be careful youre getting blood all over the car. What about the baby? Oh the babys fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. Im the one whos hurt. Would you stop it? Youre just gonna need a few stitches. A few stitches? Ive never had stitches. Ill be deformed. I cant live with that. It goes against my whole personality. Its not me! Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on give it to me give it to me. I have never seen a Mohel like that. That was a one in a million Mohel. I said Im sorry. Look at this. Oh youll be ok. Ill see you later. Wha where is he going? Oh well if it isnt Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but its not supposed to be a finger. (RE:JERRY) The circumcision was perfect. The finger was your fault! You flinched! Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya get your degree from a matchbook? (HE MAKES A SUDDEN MOVEMENT) Ya See! He flinched again! Nice Mohel picking Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel! One more peep out of you and Ill slice you up like a smoked sturgeon. Oh dont threaten me Butcher Boy. Butcher Boy?! Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHELS FLINCHING) What was this? (HE IMITATES JERRY) It was not! Jerry be careful. The Mohels got a knife! (holding the Mohel back) Hey hey whats going on out here? You two should be ashamed of yourselves both of ya! Ah blood. Oh hows the baby? Theres nothing wrong with the baby. The circumcision went fine. Thank god the flincher didnt harm the baby. Amen. I will get you for this. This is my business this is my life. No one ruins this for me. No one! (TO ELAINE) Heres my card. (off screen) Outta My Way! (struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I cant do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy They massacred my boy. You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. Youre not even close. (walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh thats the Flicks. (ON PHONE) Its a 76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well hes about five feet tall hairless pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah alright alright thank you thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the pig-man? No. No. And hes not a pig-man is he? NO hes not.. Just a fat little mental patient. Myra Stan. Dont touch him Whats the matter? Youre out Jerry. Youre out as Godfather. You too Elaine. Youre both out. But I didnt do anything. No no buts. We made up our minds. (turns to Kramer) We want Kramer. He showed us how much he cares about Steven. (Leaving: A LA GODFATHER) Dont ever go against the family Jerry. (grabbing Kramers hand) Godfather. (grabbing Kramers other hand) Godfather. Yes]
69,5,6,[Professional tennis. To me I dont understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh shh. Dont the players know that were there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they dont see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. Thats all it is. And that goofy scoring you win one point and all the sudden youre up by 15. Two points 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. Thatll be 30 love... And could you be a little quieter next time please shh. Are these seats unbelievable or what? nan Wheres the sunblock? nan Here. nan 25? You dont have anything higher? nan What are you on Mercury? nan I need higher. This has paba in it I need paba-free. nan You got a problem with paba? nan Yes I have a problem with paba. nan You dont even know what paba is. nan I know enough to stay away from it. nan 30-Love So are you going to Todds party this weekend? nan Ill go if someone else drives. You going? nan Gwen really wants to go. nan Youre bringing a date to a party? nan No good? nan A party is a bad date situation. It doesnt matter who youre with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You dont want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho ho ho. nan Whyd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to? nan Well I would think with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy. nan Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us Im obligated. nan That woman is absolutely stunning. nan Who the Croat? [the tennis player] Not the Croat the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman Ive ever seen. nan Yeah shes a B.L. nan B.L.? nan Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh Im going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry? nan You know I just heard the Lexington line is out. nan (annoyed) Uh you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting? nan Take a car service. We have an account. nan Oh forget it I hate those. Everytime I take one the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah blah blah blah blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach that would have been a good situation for me. Cause Im in the coach and the driver is way up there on the stage. nan Well youre not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in the afternoon? Read a magazine keep your head down. nan Yea I guess that could work. nan And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Coming up next mens single but for now lets stop a minute and take a look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop. nan Hey hey its George. nan Holy cow its a scorcher.

Yeah a lot of people read to relax not me. You know what I do? nan You know I-Im having a lot of trouble um hearing you back here. So... (Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey uh do you make a book of Jumbles? nan Im going to have to be honest with you. Im going deaf. nan Going deaf? nan What? nan Oh I-I-Im sorry. nan It can be very frustrating. nan Hey what about a hearing aid? nan Am I fearing AIDS? Oh yeah sure who isnt. But you know you gotta live your life. nan No no I said. Ehhh forget it. (Elaine looks pleased) I cant take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing. nan Boy you are really smitten. nan I gotta talk to her. What do you think? nan Cold? How are you going to do that? Youre not one of those guys. nan Im going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals. nan Theyre not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side. nan I have to. I wont be able to live with myself. nan Wait a minute Jerry theres a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys Ill be left here on this side. Take me with you. nan I cant. nan What are you going to say? nan I dont know Hi. nan (laughing) You think youre going to the other side with Hi? Youre not going to make it. nan Base to 92 come in Yes this is 92 After this go back to city for a 6:00 pickup Righteo 794 Bleeker the partys Hanks. Tom Hanks. nan Tom Hanks?

I think you made that whole thing up. nan No no no no. nan Yeah yeah I know your type. Youre too good to make conversation with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. But to go so far as to pretend youre almost deaf I mean that is truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks may I say he too would be disgusted by your behavior. nan Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh thats nice. Thats right ignore me. Thats real polite. Yea nobodys even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh youve got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone but its women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well what are you deaf? nan Bingo. nan And youre saying shes deaf. nan Im not *saying* shes deaf shes deaf. nan Cant hear a thing. nan Cant hear a thing. nan And youre going to go out with her. nan Yeah isnt that something? nan Hey. nan Hey. nan Hey I know how to sign. nan Really? nan Yeah when I was 8 I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I havent been able to do it in a while. nan What is this about? nan I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match. nan You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me I pretended I was going deaf. nan Wow good plan. nan Oh didnt work. He caught me hearing. Alright its terrible but Im not a terrible person. nan No. nan No. When I shoo squirrels away I always say get out of here. I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people. nan Thats nice. nan Yeah and when I see freaks in the street I never ever stare at them. Yet Im careful not to look away see because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable. nan (turning to Kramer) Thats nice for the freaks. nan Yeah and I dont poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. Ive got to make it up to this guy or I wont be able to live with myself. What can I do? nan Why dont you get him some tickets or something how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency. nan Yeah yeah Pete he can get you great tickets to something. nan Really? Like a rock concert. Whatever you like. nan Oh great thanks Kramer. nan You got it. Hey Jerry do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that. nan Kramer I think perhaps youve overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. Its ball *boys* not ball men. There are no ball men. nan Yeah I think hes right. Ive never seen a ball man. nan Well there ought to be ball men. nan All right Ill talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey. Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday. nan Yeah yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And hes... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh) Im sorry George. nan I dont understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened. nan Its not you its me. nan Youre giving me the its not you its me routine? I invented its not you its me. Nobody tells me its them not me if its anybody its me. nan All right George its you. nan Youre *damn* right its me. nan I was just trying to... I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me. nan Im sure you do it very well. nan Yes well unfortunately youll never get the chance to find out. nan But I thought things were going great. nan Yeah so did I. nan Did she say why? nan No. She tried to give me the its not you its me routine. nan But thats your routine. nan Yeah. Well aparently words out. nan Hey Georgie I saw you on TV yesterday. nan Really? At the tennis match? nan Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. nan Get out of here. I didnt see any cameras there. nan Oh the cameras was vrooom there. The announcers they made a couple of cracks about you. nan Cracks? What were they saying? nan That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked. nan Oh my god maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe thats what did it. nan Well Ill tell you it wasnt a pretty sight. nan She must have seen me eating it on TV. nan So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial? nan Why not. I would be. nan Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right Ill talk to you later bye. nan Youre parents saw me on TV? nan Yeah. nan This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on? nan It felt like 8 seconds. nan One-one-thousand two-one-thousand three-one-thousand. nan I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it? nan Can we move on? nan He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV. nan Oh come on. If shes that superficial you dont want her. nan Yes I do. nan So I guess youre not going to Todds party on Friday. nan Well I cant now Gwens going to be there. nan Well she should be the one that shouldnt go. nan Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place who withdraws? Whats the etiquette? nan Excellent question. nan I think she should withdraw. Shes the breaker hes the breakee. He needs to get on with his life. nan I beg to differ. nan Really. nan Hes the *loser*. Shes the victor. To the victor belong the spoils. nan Well I dont care I dont want to go anyway. I dont want to fight that traffic on Friday night. nan Well we can take the car service from my office. nan Really? nan Yeah they dont know. nan All right Ill see you later. nan Okay. nan (while eating a banana) Hey Georgie. To the victor goes the spoils. What are you going to do tonight? nan Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman. nan Oh. (he stands there) Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing? nan Well I was just going to wander the streets. Dont wanna tag along with you or anything. nan Oh uh do you want to come with us? nan Jerry please thats very nice but uh (closes the door) where would we be going? nan So Ive got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was thats responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship. nan They never have napkins there. nan Lets get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check? nan (does the same thing Jerry is doing) Yea. Really. I know a sign thats my first sign. nan Uh oh. That couple is breaking up. nan Theyre breaking up? How do you know? nan She reads lips. nan What are they saying now? nan Its not you its me. (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwens lips for me. nan (Puts his hand over his mouth) What? nan (Puts nuts into his mouth and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me. nan (Holds his drink up to his mouth) Shes not a novelty act George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas. nan (Puts his hands on his face rubbing his eyes) Look. Its a skill just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off. nan (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I dont know George. Im not sure about this. nan (Puts his arms in the air stretching and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her just ask her. If she says no case closed. nan (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right. nan Uh Laura George was wondering if... Sure. Ill do it. nan So I really had a good time. nan Yeah me too. nan So you want to go to the party on Friday night? nan Yeah. nan All right were taking a car service. So well swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What? nan Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here but weve only got two spots to fill. Good luck. nan (to Kramer) Hey pops isnt there a better way to spend your twilight years? nan I may be old but Im spry. nan The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up for it? nan Oh Ill be up for it punk. nan See I was saying six but she thought I was saying sex. We straightened the whole thing out though. nan She confused six with sex? nan Yeah. nan Well if she cant tell six from sex then how is she going to lip read from across the room? nan Well six and sex are close. nan Its two completely different sounds. ih and eh. nan Eh. nan It seems like a problem. nan Well Im not dating any other deaf women. nan Hey guess whos going to be the new ball man for the finals. nan Youre kidding. nan Yeah. They said they havent seen anybody go after balls with such gusto. nan Oh when is that car service coming? nan In five minutes. Hes then going to pick us up then were going to pick up Elaine and Laura is going to meet us there. nan If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? Its like having Superman for your friend. nan I know. Its like X-ray vision. nan If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain thered be no stopping us. nan Hey hey hey. (to Jerry) I hear youve got some lip reader working for you. You gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day. nan Cant do it Newman. nan But Jerry weve got this new supervisor down at the post office. Hes working behind this glass. I know theyre talking about me. Theyre going to transfer me I know it. Two hours give me two hours. nan Its not going to happen. nan (Sinister) All right all right. All right you go ahead. You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you control the mail you control... information. nan Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign. nan (The same driver as before) Pardon me sir? nan I said pull over by the stop sign. nan Im so sorry youll have to forgive me. I cant hear a damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up agains the speaker. Its a heavy metal group. Metalla-something. nan -ca. nan Huh? nan What? nan ca. nan ah. nan My ears are still ringing. Some womans idea of a joke. nan Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door. nan You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldnt have to fight the traffic on Friday night. nan I know. Im late. Hey now I know two signs (puts his hand in the air) check and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man. nan Congratulations. She doesnt know what shes talking about. nan Guys you made it. nan Hey hey. (to George) Hey buddy. Hey Todd. Sorry to hear about Gwen. nan Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me? nan Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance Ive had to talk to her. nan Really? Look George Im friends with both of you. But I cant betray her confidence by telling you anything. nan I wouldnt hear of it Todd. Its none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact Ill even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so theres no chance of me overhearing anything. nan You are so centered. nan Hey grown-up. (they both chuckle George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god there she is. Go ahead go ahead. (to the others) Lets go lets go. All right what are they saying? nan Hi Gwen hi tide. Hi tide? nan Hi Todd. nan Youve got something between your teeth Wheret? nan No thats what he said. Thats interesting. I love carrots but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas but I love pea soup. So do I. nan Shes so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon? nan No. If I lend her to you Ill have to lend her to everybody. nan I dont envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess. nan Well maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together. nan Why dont you stick around and we can sleep together. What? nan You want me to sleep with you? I dont want to sweep alone. nan He says I dont want to sleep alone. She says oh boy love to. Alright thats it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together? nan What? Youre crazy. nan What? Youre crazy. I heard your whole conversation. nan How? nan How? (looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said lets sleep together. nan No I didnt. I said sweep. Lets sweep together you know with a broom. Cleaning up. nan ... with a broom cleaning up. Sweep? nan Yes sweep. nan Yes sweep. Cut it. nan George says Cut it. Cut it. nan George is saying Cut it. Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing? nan What? She said sweep together you idiots not sleep together. I know how to sign. nan Ow. My eye my eye. nan Its so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals. nan I know and on the first tournament of her comeback. nan Thus ends the great ball man experiment. nan (The same driver as before) You with the tennis center? nan Yep. nan Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Seles. Wasnt that something. nan Im deaf. nan Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.) Ive always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check Check. Unless the waiter isnt too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over Do you want the check? No I wanna be pen pals cant you see what Im doing here? Im trying to be cool and impress people. nan]

(acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? Youre (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them. What about me? You? Youre getting old. Maybe your yogurt isnt so non-fat. Oh guess again Tubby! Jerry theres got to be a way to find that out. There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing. AH! Ive got it. What? Ill call the Food and Drug Administration. Hey Ill tell you what Chubs if that yogurt has fat in it I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week. Well lets start the insanity. NNNN-Giddy-up! Tommy Tune is a very good dancer. (hits George on the head with what seems to be the tvguide) You ever see Tommy Tune dance? No. I like tap dancing. Tap dancing. Anyone can tap dance. Its all in those shoes. Are you kidding? They practice for years those people. Whats for supper? Somebodys at the door. Tommy Tune is very tall. That helps. It makes him lankier. (answers the door) Lloyd? Hello Mrs. Costanza. Georgie Lloyd Braun is here. Hey! Lloyd! What are you doing here? Well I was just in the neighborhood visiting my mother so I thought Id drop by and say Hello. Georgie. Come here and say hello. How are you doing Lloyd? I hear youre a big advisor for Dinkins now. Thats right. Hey George. Hey Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) Hows it going? (chuckles) I uh ran into George yesterday in the city. Ow! (hits George on the forehead) Whats the matter with you? So uh hows the arm huh? Oh its good. Whats the matter with your arm? Nothing. Oh his arm moves like this. (does the nudging motion) Your arm moves like this? (does the nudging motion) Yeah. (continues to move his arm) I never seen your arm move like this. Me either. Well it comes and goes. Its like some kind of aaaaa (snapping his fingers) spasm. Ooh! I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew any good orthopedists and he said he had the best. (hands George the Doctors card) So I made an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter. Mayor Dinkins got an appointment for him? You mentioned Georges name to Mayor Dinkins? You discussed George with the mayor of New York? Dinkins was talking about you. He was discussing you. You know Lloyd I-Ive been to the doctor (hands George the card) theres really nothing they can do. (grabbing the card) Hey Mayor Dinkins set this up for you. You know what kind of a doctor this must be if Dinkins knows him? All right. All right! Ill go. Well thats great. (grabs the card back from Frank and hands it to George again) And uh Ill be very interested to hear the diagnosis. Uh-huh. Okay well were coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. Its in Brooklyn. We have to drive there. And they said they can do it? Yeah its forty-five bucks. All right. Lets go down to the yogurt store and well get a specimen. Hm-hmm. Well I hope youre satisfied. What? Every word out of my sons mouth now is *beep*(fuck) *beep*(fuck) *beep*(fuck). (Jerry half turns and puts his head done for a second) You know what he said to me five minutes ago? Wheres my *beep*(fuck)ing cupcake? Gee Im really sorry. He wants to be like you because youre a comedian. Maybe you could talk to him? Id be happy to. Thank you. Ah Mary weve been eating a lot of your husbands uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it? No *beep*(fuck)ing way! Well it was very nice seeing you again. Oh it was good seeing you. Oh um by the way who was that gorgeous woman I saw you with the other day? Oh uh just a friend of mine. You must mean Elaine. Isnt she adorable? She is. She is. How about giving me her number? Oh you know Lloyd I really dont have it. She works at Pendant Publishing. Elaine Benes. Oh great. (nudges George on the chin) Thanks a lot! Yeah! Buh bye. Bye! (Lloyd leaves) Oh that Lloyd Braun. He is something isnt he? Well I wouldnt hear of it. I said Nice try granny! And I sent her to the back of the line! Hello Newman. Hello Jerry. Say this yogurt is really something huh? And its non-fat! Ive been waiting for something like this my whole life! And its finally here! Hey Seinfeld. Id appreciate it if youd stop using obscenities around my son huh? It was an accident. Im going to talk to him. I want a small plain vanilla in a cup to go. Thats non-fat right? Thats right. Cause Im on a special diet and the doctor said I cant have any fat. Yeah well there is no fat. Hey another round of strawberry for me and my friends. Hurry Jerry! Hurry! Hows it doing? Not so good. Well you cant have this tested now. Its melting. So what. It changes the molecules. Oh you dont know what youre talking about. Hey fatso! I got a 90 in biology. You call me fatso one more time; youre going to be walking back. Um hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested. Oh right. Would you fill this out please? Uh does it matter if its melted? No! (Jerry looks at Kramer) You know this is going to take a couple of days. Thats okay. Hello there. Hello! Ooh! Test tubes. Cool! What do you got there? Actually this is Mr. Giulianis blood. Were doing a cholesterol work up on it. Oh. Okay Im done. It was really nice meeting you. Well the pleasures all mine. You cant take that chemist out. Why not? Because shes like the jury. Shes going to be sequestered. Im not taking her out just to influence the results. Well I think the whole thing stinks. It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad. Thats enough. What? With the smelling. So he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins doctor. Hes just trying to humiliate me. Uh-huh. And I have to go. If I dont go hell know Im lying. Well so what are you going to do? Sit in the doctors office doing this? (moves his arm) Hes gonna think youre a mental patient. I dont care. Look Lloyd doesnt know what hes up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie. Hey! Hey Hey. So guess who called me. Oh dont tell me. Lloyd? Were going out tomorrow night. Oh look hes going to ask you about my arm. So just tell him I banged it against a desk. And its been moving involuntarily ever since. I cant say that. Why not? What if I like him? Im going to start out lying to this guy? So youre taking his side? No. But what if we get married or something? Well always have that between us. Already youre marrying this guy? You never know. All right believe me youre not going to marry him. All right well then what if we become a couple George? Every time we see you youre going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you cant keep that up. No I believe he can. Hi! Hi! You know Jerry. Of course hes the funny *beep*(fuck). See! Listen Matthew I-I want to explain something to you. Now cursing is not something that most comedians do. You did it. Thats true. But it was an accident. And I havent done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing youll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second. You know Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does. Yeah yeah. Big advisor. He tells him which soap to use. (quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)! Shh! We dont want to disturb the security guard. Wheres the lights. Whoa! How about this? Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya. Oo. Yaow. Ha hea. You want a taste? Its Cappuccino. Its delicious. I hear you. Non-fat? Well you tell me. Is the verdict in yet? No. Well this is in case theres a tie! Well as far as I know he bumped his arm into a door and its kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So anyway youre a..youre a big advisor to Dinkins huh? Yeah yeah. Its coming right down to the wire. Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier. Name tags hmm? Well everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town. Maybe Ill mention that to him. Really? Wow. You sure you dont want any yogurt? No Im watching my weight. Well its non-fat. Yeah so they say. Well Im done should we go? Yeah. Okay. Three days and he hasnt called me and you know why? Because he thinks Im too fat. (surprised) He said that? (stands up straight) No but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says Boy youre a lot of woman! Hey! So hear anything on the yogurt? No but I expect to hear anytime. Well I wouldnt get your hopes up. Why do you say that? No reason. Oh did you hear about that Dinkins? No. What about him? You didnt hear? Un-huh. Hes proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags. Name tags? Yeah! So people can go around saying hello to one another. Oh I see. So you can go Hey you know who I saw wilding today? Herb! Hes become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags! (on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh really? Okay thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat! Yeow! The next morning I woke up and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise (arm moves) oh. Uh huh. Yes well Im going to have to be perfectly honest with you. Please doctor. Ive examined you. Yes. Ive looked at your X-rays. Uh-huh. And I find that theres absolutely nothing wrong with you. Hmm. Really? Nothing? Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms. Well its kind of a mystery isnt it? No not really. How so? May I suggest the possibility that youre faking? Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors take X-rays make appointments when theres absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that? I dont know what kind of a person would do something like that. Obviously a very sick person. A very immature person. A person who has no regard for wasting other peoples valuable time. Good-bye. Now see here doctor. I said good-bye. Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow! Jerry come on look. Lets go over to that yogurt store. Look Elaine Ive been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey look wait a second (looking at the TV) Kramer turn that up. Huh Okay. Rudy Giuliani who underwent a physical last week received some startling news today when his cholesterol count turned out to be a whopping 375. What effect this will have on the minds of the voters remains to be seen. In another development Mayor Dinkins has fired his top advisor Lloyd Braun who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco. We now take you to Giuliani headquarters where Rudy Giuliani is about to make a statement. Its hard to understand. Because Ive been doing everything I normally do. Ive been watching my diet very carefully. I exercise regularly. My only indulgence I guess would be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt. But its non-fat. Non-fat yogurt? Oh my god. They got Giuliani and he doesnt even know it. (pointing to Kramer) Now look what youve done. Well weve got to do something. (grabs his phone) Im calling Giulianis headquarters. Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that. I dont think its so bad. People should wear name tags. Everyone would be a lot friendlier. Hello Sam. How are you doing Joe? (Georges arm moves and hits the lamp) Hey your arm. It moved again. I thought you said it went away. I banged it on the desk in the doctors office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . . Be quiet. Theyre starting the press conference. My campaign staff has received some very disturbing information regarding the fat content in yogurt thats being sold throughout the city. I pledge to you now that if Im elected mayor as my first order of business Ill appoint a special task force to investigate this matter. I promise you my fellow New Yorkers that Mayor Giuliani will do everything possible to cleanse this city of this falsified non-fat yogurt. The old yogurt was so much better. Oh this is terrible. Phew! Oh it stinks. Mine too. I got one more day. I cant eat this. (from the corner of the Yogurt shop) Hey Jerry. Thanks a lot. I hope youre happy. It had fat in it its not good for you. I dont care. It was good. I was enjoying it. Had to interfere. Couldnt leave well enough alone. Well I will get even with you for this. You can count on it. Hey you guys listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giulianis test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office. So in effect the yogurt won him the election. I wonder what actually happened in that lab. Yeah me too. I cant eat this. (hits Jerry to get his attention) Thanks for ruining my daddys business you fat *beep*(fuck).]

Well well just see about that. Ta-ta Tut-tle. nan Gee George Im sorry I gave you the wrong impression. What is was going to say was now you are aware that our Board of Directors has been indicted myself included and were prohibited from doing business until the investigation is completed. So obviously we would have no use for you. nan Obviously. nan Yes. nan (over the speaker) Excuse me but Mr. Costanzas car is being towed. nan (on the phone in Jerrys apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out? (on the phone in his apartment with a Bald head) Not for a while.]
72,5,9,[No eight years isnt such a long streak. nan It isnt? nan No I havent vomited in thirteen years. nan Get out! nan Not since June 29 1980. nan You remember the date? nan Yes because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. Thats why during the 80 vomit I was yelling to George: Can you believe it? Im vomiting on June 29th again. Boy you know when Joel told me he hadnt thrown up in eight years I was wondering if he was normal. nan No Elaine hes normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York. nan Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaines office) Oh Jer I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up) Hi we just saw your boyfriend at a bus stop. nan Oh yeah? nan Yeah. Whats his name? nan Joel... Joel what? nan Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin. nan Rifkin? Joel Rifkin? nan Yeah. Its just a coincidence obviously. nan Guess you better keep on his good side. nan Very funny. Thats very funny. nan I wouldnt sleep with my back to him if I were you. nan All right. Well thats enough of that. Thats enough. nan Hey Elaine listen. If you smell anything decaying in the trunk of his car... (shes upset gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend were talking about OK? And hes a gentlemen hes good looking hes a good shaver and he hasnt thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up! nan The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin and I am dating a Joel Rifkin. nan But you like your Joel Rifkin. nan Yeah. I just wish he has a different name. nan Ask him to change it. nan You cant ask a person to change their name. nan Why not? nan Would you change yours? nan If someone asked me nicely. Im Claude Seinfeld. nan Hey how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen? nan Yeah. Eighteen strangles. nan You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as hes taking a lot of paper towels from Jerrys roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramers statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we dont know why he needed so much paper towels) You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game. nan Ill go. nan O.K. Ill leave the ticket for you at will call. nan Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again) You think I should have asked George? nan Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen? nan Karen? nan Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto as opposed to when she has sex with him) Oh! The Risotto broad. nan Yeah. Hes really got a good thing with her. In fact Im doubling with them tonight. nan I tought you didnt like double dates. nan George likes them he feels its a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality. nan Ive looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds. nan He feels hes funnier more relaxed. nan And youre taking... Jody the masseuse. nan Hey did you get a massage yet? nan No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage? nan Jerry she gives massages all day. She doesnt wanna to give them on dates. nan Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex. nan So what? nan So its like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots but Im in Idhao I want a potato. nan (George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her: Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that whats your tought process? Whats going on in your mind? That is so funny. nan (to Jody) Youre listening to this? nan Yeah. I heard you. nan (to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here. nan (to George) So what did she say? nan Well nothing. I didnt actually say that. (Karen is still laughing) You just said that you said it. nan Sweetheart I was exaggerating. nan Im learning a lot about you tonight George. Ive never seen you like this. nan (touching the back of his neck) Its like somebodys pulling on wires back here. nan You know its like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket. nan How can you say that? My sister got a ticket last week. Are you saying shes not attractive? nan Well Ive never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart. nan (to Jerry) Can we go? nan Yeah. Lets go. nan So soon? (they get up) Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen. nan Yeah. nan Nice meeting you Karen. nan Yeah. Nice to meet you too and Im gonna call you about that massage. nan Oh yeah. nan Jody lets do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him) Yeah. (she and Jerry walk away) I strained my neck last night. nan Really how? nan I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didnt work. nan So whats the deal with your friend George? nan No deal. Why? nan What was all that attractive women not getting tickets nonsense? nan Oh well he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality. nan I dont know how you can hang out with that guy. nan Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jodys hand and put it on his shoulder) Did you see the way that he was eating? nan Yeah hes disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV) I have to tell you I really dont like him. nan Yeah me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder) Its just I hate that type. nan Yeah hes a bad seed. nan Now you however you I like. (she stops massaging and kisses Jerry) What are you doing? nan What do you think Im doing? (he wont get his massage...) So what do you think? nan Really enjoyed it. nan Jodys nice. nan Shes very nice. (grabs Georges hand) Lets discuss this later. nan You think she liked me? She seemed to like me. nan Yeah I was personable. Dont you think I was personable? nan You were extremely personable. nan I tought I picked up a little something. Im very good at this. Did you pick up anything? nan I didnt pick up anything. nan The second time I sent the noodles back I tought she made a face... I didnt see a face. nan I tought I saw a face. nan Anyhow what is the difference? nan No difference. I could care less. Shes Jerrys girlfriend. nan George George instead of talking about this we could be... you know... (she makes a move with her head like George did in The Mango while saying: instead of the movie...) He he he he Ah ah ah ah So you think she likes me? nan (as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing? nan Massaging your neck. nan Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging. nan Uh boning up on football? (talking about the magazine shes reading as he sits beside her) Yeah yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name Deon. If I were gonna change my name Id go with Deon. nan Deon Benes? nan Well as a woman it makes no sense. But I mean lets say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool. nan D-Deon Rifkin? nan Well maybe youre not the Dion type. O.K. then lets see lets see what do we got? (looking at the magazine she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You dont even use a name its just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please it would be so great! nan Elaine! What is going on? nan She stayed over? nan Yeah. (disappointed) The sex wasnt so good? nan No. The sex was fabulous. nan So? nan I want the massage! nan Did you ask her? nan I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately shes not into it. nan Why not? nan I guess cause its her job. Its very frustrating. nan So we had a good time... the four of us. nan Yeah. nan We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant. nan Yeah. nan What did Jodi say? nan She had a good time. nan Is that it? nan Pretty much. nan Did she say anything about uh... What? nan Nah. Its all right. Great! She had a good time. nan Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee) You just hesitated. nan I was blowing on the coffee. nan She didnt like me? nan Look its not like youre gonna be spending a lot of time with her. nan So she doesnt like me? nan No. nan She said that? nan Yes. nan She told you she doesnt like me! nan Yes. nan What were her exact-- I dont like him. Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didnt she like me? nan Not everybody likes everybody! nan I tried to be nice. I wasnt nice? nan You were very nice! nan I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister? nan It has nothing to do with her sister. nan I dont even know her sister but believe me if shes getting traffic tickets shes not that good-looking! Woah You vomited in 1987. nan Oh no. That was the dry heaves. nan Jodi. nan Hey Jerry. nan Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like: its so great to be all here) What are you doing here? nan I was giving Kramer a massage. nan Kramer! (tries to hide hes upset and jealous) I got to run. I have an appointment downtown. nan Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you. nan No thats O.K. nan Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. Im going this way. (he takes the table from Jodis hands and she has no choice but to follow him) Ill see you tonight. (hes opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe) Hey! I am looser than creamed corn! nan Who told you to get a massage from her. I havent gotten a massage from her yet! nan You dont know what youre missing buddy. nan No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi lets get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me. nan Youve never met. (the cab starts and George is following to keep talking to Jodi) Whatever. Believe me if I wasnt involved right now I wouldnt mind being set up. Something tells me shes a knockout. (we see from the camera inside the cab Georges hand waving as the cab drives away) (Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky soft fingers you can scarcely contain yourself buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch) So you had a good time. nan Oh... yeah... Enjoyed yourself. nan Very... much... All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramers legs and throws him down the couch) What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking) The massages are out! nan Wha-- Ahh!!! Theyre out! nan Why?! nan Because if I cant get one youre not getting one. nan Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Cant you see Im burned out! nan Im sorry Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen) Why? Why? Look I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking) Dont you ever talk about her like that! nan But why? nan Thats final!!! nan Ah!!! Yahh!!! nan Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to Giants stadium. Oh you have photos in your wallet? nan Yeah. Why? Is that weird? nan No its normal. Youre very normal. Youre totally normal. Whos this? nan Thats my mother. nan Oh yeah. I see the resemblance. nan No theres no resemblance. nan Yeah there is right here you see-- Elaine I was adopted. nan (pause) Oh. Thats nice. nan Oh the games about to start. I wonder where your friend Kramer is. nan (to the ticket man) Uh yeah a ticket for Kramer. nan Here it is. I need some I.D. nan Oh yeah. (snaps fingers) You know I forgot my wallet. nan Well I cant give it to you then. nan Are you kidding me? nan Im afraid not. nan Come on just look at me. Tell me Im not Kramer. nan Im sorry. I need proof. nan Look Ill drive out here tomorrow and Ill show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day. nan Neither do I. But without I.D. I need confirmation from the person who left the ticket. nan Wheres a phone? nan Ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please? Would Joel Rifkin report to the stadium office. Joel Rifkin...telephone. (the crowd stops cheering and we see a football player Lawrence Taylor of the N.Y. Giants distracted from the game while hearing the announcer saying Joel Rifkin) Who would be calling me here? (he stands up and look around) (to the person in front of her) Hes not the murderer. nan Oh God. nan Whats the matter with you? nan Jerry I need another massage! nan You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for? nan Because of the Giant game! I told you It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. Theyre very unforgiving. nan Oh please. nan And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back its killing me! (whining) Its killing me Jerry! nan Well did you get the ball? nan Oh I got the ball. nan Well I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game. nan Well Its quite a thrill. nan Why dont you get somebody else? nan Because nobody does it like she does. Shes the best. nan Well thats it! Tonights the night. Im getting one. No if ands or buts. nan What about my massage? nan (whining like Kramer) Ask Newman. nan So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things? nan Of course. nan No I dont know. Maybe you havent. You know not everybodys seen a massage table. nan What do you think Ive never had a massage before? nan Anyway I dont even get a thank you. I dont get it! nan George frankly Im getting a little tired of hearing about her. nan I wanna know what I did to this woman. nan What you got a little thing for her? nan No No! Shes going out with a friend of mine. Its only courteous that we should try and like each other. nan What difference does it make? Who cares if she doesnt like you? Does everybody in the world have to like you? nan Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked! nan Of course I support your decision to change your name. nan After the Giant game I realized that this--this problem isnt going away. nan Well listen I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin. nan Sure? nan (she fakes a strangling) RRR... O.K. you got your list? nan Yeah. Yeah. 10 names. nan Right. nan O.K. And if somebody objects you can just veto it. nan O.K. nan O.K. You start. Whats your first choice? nan Stuart. nan (right away) No. Second choice. nan Stu--Stuarts no good? nan I have never met a normal guy named Stuart. nan O-O.K. My second choice is... Todd. nan (repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto. nan All right. Oh hey I think youre gonna like my first my third choice. nan Great... Alex. nan I gotta tell ya I have a bad association with the name Alex. nan Bad bad association? nan Yeah in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: Ahh. I mean every two seconds: Ahh. And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: Ahh. I had to drop the class. nan Hey. nan Hi. nan Hi. (kiss) I was running late and I didnt have a chance to drop off my stuff before I came over. nan Ah no problem. Thats fine. nan Whats with this music? nan Thats new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table) What are you doing? nan Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? Thats a hell of a piece of equipment. nan Actually I should get a new one. nan No nonsense. This ones fine. (as he sits on the table) So where do you wanna go? (as she puts her hand on his shoulder) Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh that feels good. Yeah. Thats uh... Thats good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah thats nice. Thats very nice. nan (she stops massaging) No. No this isnt good. I cant do this. nan Why whats wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders) I cant (she tries harder to pull her hands away) No. Yes you can. (he hangs on) No I cant! nan Come on! I know its something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table) You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. Ive got to. (he grabs his jacket) Ive got to. nan Youre going now? nan I think I can still catch her. nan All right George. I have had just about enough of this. nan What? What are you talking about. nan I am talking about you and Jodi. Youre completely obsessed with her! nan I know. I know. nan Who is more important to you her or me? I like you she doesnt. Who are you gonna pick? nan (he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) Im sorry Karen. I know I care for you but I just cant stand when someone doesnt like me. (he opens the door) Well now I hate you! nan That Im used to. (he leaves) Ned? nan What is wrong with Ned? nan Neds a guy who buys irregular underwear. Next! nan Ellis. nan Ellis?! You might as well go with Alex. Its the same thing! nan Ellis and Alex arent even close. nan NEXT! nan Ohh what is the point? nan NO NO. COME ON! nan O.K. O.K. Remy. nan Remy Rifkin? Should I get a beret? nan Oh Stuarts a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother. nan Grrrr! nan What do you mean no? nan No means no. nan Look who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils and Im not supposed to expect anything? Youre a massage teaser. nan Listen. I massage who I want when I want. I dont submit to forcible massage. (he tries desperately to get her hands on his shoulders again but she pulls them away immediately) Im getting out of here. nan Fine. Go. nan Jerry could you excuse us for a few minutes please? nan What for? nan We need to talk. nan You need to talk? nan We have nothing to talk about. nan Look its no secret whats going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesnt like me. Now Jerry if you dont mind. nan George anything you have to say to her you can say in front of me. nan (he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. Im starting to like her. nan What? nan She just dislikes me so much... Its irresistable. nan I can see that. nan Im getting out of here. (to Jerry) Dont call me. nan Dont worry. (she leaves) A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime. nan Youre a lucky guy. nan I got to go after her. nan George. I wouldnt push for the massage. (George nods) JODI! (he starts running after her) The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people for some reason. But its weird because they have the highest suicide rate theyre rubbing each others necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I dont really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I dont want people touching me that dont know me and dont want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up juices flowing and then thats it ok youre done. Its like having chocolate rubbed all over your face you know you wanna go Excuse me I think you missed a spot.]

How can you have a cigar store without an Indian? Its unseemly. nan Ill give you a box of Coronas for it. nan Forget it. nan Uh excuse me. Are you uh selling this Indian? nan Oh yeah yeah. nan Uh Im just uh redecorating my office in a south-western motif and thisd be perfect. Give you five hundred dollars for it? nan Giddyup. nan Yeah?

(sees Kramer) Kramer! nan Yeah hi Elaine. nan What are you doing in here with that? nan Ah well its a business transaction. nan (entering smoking a cigar and with a handful of cash) Listen uh petty cash just had tens and twenties. (hands cash to Kramer) Go ahead count it. nan Yeah Im sure its all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table out there in the hall. nan You like that huh? I had that custom made for me in Santa Fe. nan You mind if I use it in my book? nan What book? nan Well Im doing a coffee table book on coffee tables. nan About coffee tables? nan Uh huh. nan Thats fantastic. (Elaine looks gobsmacked) Whos your publisher? nan Well Im still shopping it around. nan Yeah? (to Elaine) You see this is the kind of idea you should be coming in with. What the hell do you do round here all day anyway? nan Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I... (ignoring Elaine) God that Indian really completes the room. Dont you think? nan I know this coffee table its George Costanzas. nan Its mine. Im his mother. nan Oh I havent seen George for a while. He must be working very hard. nan George doesnt work. Hes a bum. Thats why he lives at home with us. nan He does? nan I dont know why we didnt think of this before. We just could call TV Guide. nan I dunno. nan Well its gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine) I guess. nan Whats the matter? nan What dyou think is the matter? Ive been assigned to work on Kramers coffee table book. nan It is a good idea Elaine. nan Next stop Queensboro Plaza. nan You want a gyro? nan I dont think so. nan Elaine! nan Guess your boyfriends gonna have to catch the next train. nan Hes not my boyfriend. nan Hes not? Interesting. (gives a big grin) I was always excited as a kid when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front covers nice and flat seems like theres good fresh TV shows in. Then as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everythings getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown never handed to another person. Its the worlds most thrown reading material. Wheres TV Guide? (mimes throwing) There it is. You know in the back of the TV Guide they have a phone number ninety-five cents a minute they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is if you cant do the TV Guide crossword puzzle where are you coming across ninety-five cents? nan]
74,5,11,[Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh a little expensive. nan Twenty five dollars. nan Yes well you know Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster. nan George George uh I think we have to talk. I think we have a problem. nan We do? nan We cant keep seeing each other. nan Why? nan (crying) Because its over. (sob sob sob) Its my parents George the differences in our religion. Oh George can you ever forgive me? (sob) (crying) Yes. Ill have the lobster. nan Um you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go. nan Then he asked you out? nan We started to talk and I told him that I jog and then he put his hand on my heart. nan On your heart? nan Jerry the man is a doctor. nan Doctor? Hes a podiatrist. nan So its the same thing. nan Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school. nan Really? nan Hello. nan Oh hi. nan Are you going to be stopping by later? nan Yes Ill be stopping. nan Ok see you later. See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs) Its over. nan What? nan How did you get in? nan Kramer. nan Whats that? (points at some foil on the table) Lobster. nan Looks like a swan. nan She says we cant go out anymore. nan Why? nan Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox. nan Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm it is lobster. nan Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad. nan I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true. nan Oh whatever. Mmm this is delicious. nan Mmm succulent. nan She knew I didnt have a job she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman. nan Why dont you just ask her parents? nan I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know in the cab on the way over here I actually thought about converting. nan To Latvian Orthodox? nan Why not? What do I care? nan You know its not like changing toothpaste. nan I think it would be romantic. nan Really? nan Yeah its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh. nan King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward Jerry. nan Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza. nan You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference. nan George I was just kidding around. nan No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her. nan George I wasnt serious. nan How hard could it be? You make a little contribution you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this. nan I guess this one is my fault. nan Oh yeah. nan (kiss kiss kiss) Oh that was nice. Have you always been such a good kisser? nan Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing I would be up in my room practicing my kissing. nan Well it was worth it. (kiss) Ill be (kiss) right (kiss) back (kiss). Where are you going? nan To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange. nan Meet you back here? nan Right there. nan (thinking to himself; picks up a tube) Fungicide. Fungus? nan Fungicide. I mean what could she have? nan I dont know. nan Fungus. nan Exactly So what did you say? nan I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home. nan I dont know what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet? nan I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little. nan You were snooping. nan I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that. nan I would. I always open medicine cabinets. nan Well I trust people not to do that. nan Big mistake. nan Why dont you ask that doctor what it is? nan What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist. nan But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus. nan I am not going to ask him about funguses. nan Fungi. nan What? nan Fungi. nan Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox faith? nan (ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um... (trying to think of a word) Enigmatic? nan No. nan Vast? (he pronounces it as vost) No not vast (he pronounces it as vost) Well whatever it is basically you like the religion. nan Yes. nan (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious. nan Are you familiar with Orthodox theology? nan Well perhaps not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah. nan Plot? nan Yes. You know the uh flood and the uh lepers and the commandments and all that. nan Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So uh pffft am I in? nan The first step would be to familiarize yourself with these texts (brings out a pile of books). nan Ah hah. You see Father Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change? nan Oh Im sorry. Father theres a man waiting in the chapel. nan You may attend to it Sister oh this is George Costanza. He is interested in joining the church. nan Oh are you? Thats wonderful. Well good luck to you. nan Nice nun. nan No Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we call a novice. nan May I help you? nan Oh yeah Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza. nan Well hes in with the Father. nan Oh yeah. nan Im Sister Roberta. nan Oh. Kramer. Pleasure. nan Mine. (she smiles at Kramer) I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books memorize a few prayers and Im in the club. nan Thats all there is to it. nan Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza. nan And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza? nan Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence. nan Oh a slinky. Sister Roberta gave it to me. nan Why did she give you that? nan I think she liked me. nan What do you mean she liked you? nan Liked me. nan Kramer they like everybody. Theyre friendly people. nan No. I think I picked up on a vibe. nan You picked up on a vibe from a nun. nan Yeah Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it. nan Yea alright. nan Oh thats my phone. Oh hi. nan Hi I just wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling. nan (weakly) A little better. (fake cough) If you need anything let me know. nan Okay. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. Story. nan Shes subletting Carols place for a month. nan Yea she likes you. nan Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet. nan So? nan So I dont know what shes using it for. nan Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube? nan I didnt even think to look. nan Well take a look. It might not even belong to her. nan Yeah. nan People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet. nan Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine. nan I still have brill cream. nan Hi Hi. nan Hi. Can I use your bathroom? nan You sure you dont mind? nan No of course not. People ask me medical questions all the time. nan Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend. nan Elaine Im used to it. Im a doctor. nan Well... podiatrist. nan Huh? nan No no Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way. nan I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose to work with feet. nan I like feet too. Im just saying... Saying what? nan How are you doing in there? nan Fine all done just looking for the soap. nan No soap? nan No I dont see it. nan (giving Jerry the soap) Here you go. nan George what are you doing in there? nan What? Nothing. nan Youve been in there an hour. nan You dont feel well? nan Im fine. nan I want to know what youre doing in there. nan Nothing. nan George open the door. nan No. nan Georgie. nan No! nan Hey. nan Good evening. I hope Im not disturbing you but I found another toy I thought you might like. nan Okay Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question. nan I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test. nan Hey did you talk to the doctor? nan No. nan All right the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.) You took her medicine. nan Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again? nan I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors. nan How could you say that? nan Its you fault. You just got me thinking. nan I was merely speaking extemporaneously. nan Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot. nan Me too. nan Do you think I should call him and apologize? nan Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing? nan What does it look like Im doing? nan (Reading words George wrote on his hand) Matthew Luke Paul what youre cheating on your conversion chest? nan I told you. nan What? nan I told you she liked me. nan Who? nan Sister Roberta. nan How do you know? nan She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church. nan Wow Oh uh this power. Im dangerous Jerry Im very very dangerous. nan I must say George I was somewhat surprised at the results of your conversion test. I dont recall having seen such an impressive performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord. nan Oh Im Im full of it Father. nan Yes yes I see. (To George) Im sorry something has come up. nan Oh I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey. (rushed) Yea Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um you wanted to see me Father? nan Yes. Please sit down. Sister Roberta came to see me yesterday. nan I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that that I have this power. nan Yes. Kavorka. nan Kavorka? nan It is a Latvian word which means the lure of the animal. nan I dont understand. nan Women are drawn to you. They would give anything to be possessed by you. nan Help me Father. Help me. nan Yes yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. I want you to buy ten cloves of garlic three quarts of vinegar six ounces... What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah. nan Hey. nan Hey. What are you doing? nan Ive got the Kavorka Jerry. nan The Kavorka? Whats that? nan The lure of the animal. Im dangerous. nan What is this thing around your neck? nan The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar. nan You know youre funcifying the whole building. nan Keep away Jerry. Keep away. nan Kramer. (knock knock knock) Kramer. nan George Costanza? Estelles son? nan Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this? nan For a woman. nan A woman? What are you out of your mind? nan Why cant you do anything like a normal person? nan Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels? nan No its a regular religion. nan Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to get out of this. nan I dont want to get out of it. nan Bu George you dont know what youre saying. Youre under their control. nan What they brainwashed you? nan No no. nan Youre not performing any rituals in this house. nan Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you. nan And stay away from those squirrels. nan Oh how you doing Jerry? nan Good. Whats the matter? nan Im tired. I hardly slept last night with all this scratching. Bonkers was going crazy. nan Bonkers? nan My cat. Hes got this weird sort of skin condition. Some type of fungus I couldnt find his medicine. nan Oh its your cat! nan What? nan Ooh nothing. nan Are you ready my son? nan Yes faddah. nan What did you say? nan What? nan I thought you said faddah. nan I said faddah I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous. nan Ooh of course. How you doing? nan Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.) Yes Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got time to catch her. nan Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister Roberta would you please offer the final benediction. nan (hesitates) I cant. (crowd murmurs) Im sorry. Its a beautiful religion but I am not worthy of it. I found something else. nan Him. nan Kavorka Kavorka. nan (kiss kiss) You know because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot. nan Well its my fault. I got a little defensive. nan And that pinkie toe come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe. nan Its my favorite toe. nan Lets face it you get a bunion where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy. nan No youre not. nan Ill be right back. nan Oh uh wheres the bathroom? nan Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here. nan Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back. nan (Thinking to himself) Fungicide? Fungus? nan Somethings wrong. I dont feel the same lure. nan You dont? nan What have I...? I must return to the church. By the way you really need to take a bath. You stink. nan Yeah yeah. nan But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet youre never using it again. Any medicine youre using is on the sink. Its not really even a medicine cabinet its really like an ointment museum isnt it? Its like heres a saff from 1983 some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin Tinactin. Well I guess Ill be calling the shots in this relationship from now on. For me? nan Well I didnt do it for my mother. nan Im really flattered. But I just dont feel ready to make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia. nan Latvia? nan Yes. Im going to stay with some relatives there for a year. Isnt it great? nan Enjoy enjoy. nan Oh George you are so sweet. Dont ever change. nan Id like a doggie bag for this please.

75,5,12,[The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.

Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. Its like a Wiley Coyote idea isnt it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why dont they just wear a party hat? Whats the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesnt open I got news for you the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmets talking to the other helmets going boy its a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.]
76,5,13,[Hey do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? Its February. I once got Happy New Yeared in March. Its disgusting. Its pathetic. . . . hey is it cold out? Really cold. Scary cold. I dont know. Whats your definition of scary cold? That. (pointing at George) (Laughing as she says it) What is that ha? What? When did you get that? This week.

You mean just going there because Im invited thats rude? Yes. So youre telling me instead of them being happy to see me theyre going to be upset because I didnt bring anything. Ttst --You see what Im saying? The fabric of society is very complex George. I dont even drink wine. I drink Pepsi. Ya cant bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves) Why not? Because were adults? You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort) no way wine is better than Pepsi. I tell you George I dont think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table. I just dont like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation theres this annoying little chore that goes along with it. You know youre getting to be an annoying little chore yourself. All right lets go. Whos driving? (claps his hands and rubs them together) You are. I cant get that thing in my car. (referring to George) Uh huh. Wheres the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up oh! Im cold. Just give me a little squeeze. Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off Get off of Me!

The four of us cant show up with just one bottle of wine. Oh here we go... What? Why dont we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional. (low tone)Yeahhehehehe We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery? (low tone) All right yeah. Why dont you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store? Ring Dings? Hey Ring Dings are better than anything youre gonna get at a bakery. Ooooh I like Ring Dings. George we cant show up at someones house with Ring Dings and Pepsi. HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON! (shouting out the window) (to Kramer) Its a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me just between you and me Im really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . . Oh Kramer thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. (low tone) All right. Okay let me out. You eh whatever your name is... Jerry. Yeah Jerry Jerry -- come with me. Okay so were going to get the wine and well pick you up here in ten minutes. Yeah. All right Ummm I love the smell of bakeries. Mmm. Oh look Elaine the black and white cookie. Mmm. I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. Its a wonderful thing isnt it? You know I often wonder what youll be like when youre senile. Im looking forward to it. Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you. Thank you. All right look at all this stuff. What are we getting? CHOCOLATE BABKA! Thats their specialty. Love that babka. Yeah yeah! So listen Elaine when we get up to the door you  you hold the cake box. Why? I dont know just standing there with a box holding it by the little string. You think its effeminate? Its a tad dainty. Oh we forgot to pick a number. Oh see thats not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people. I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers? Ah no forget it. No no no no no its not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesnt mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them and them and her. Come on lets just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me. (exhales) Well Im not finding a spot here. What do you want to do? Ah Just double park. No no. Why not? Ill get a ticket! Besides what if somebody wants to get out of here? Are you kidding? People get spaces this good they never give em up. Thats a fallacy. All right Ill tell you what... why dont you go into the store and Ill wait in the car? Why dont YOU go into the store and ILL wait in the car? Because Ive got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold. So what Im going to leave the car running and the heat ll be on. Does the heater even work in this car? No. Oh Hey eh theres a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see I see. You see hu ho ho. But we were here ahead of you. How do I know that? Well we saw you come in. Well thats easy for you to say. Oh yeah right thats something I do all the time right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries. 46? Wait wait a second are are you Barbara Benedict? Yes. Oh my god. I I know you. I-Im Im Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Graks baby shower. Im on my way over there right now.

Alright what are we getting? Its hot in here! Ooo What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet? Whats that? Well its a Bordeaux. Robust bold very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais -- which is richer and fruitier. Ahh heres one. Twelve dollars. Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake. All right look I am going to have to pay you back later. I dont have my wallet. . . . Why not? Because I dont like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that its bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips) throws your hips off kilter So wheres your money? (pulls out his wallet) I never take it. So what do you do? Oh I get by. See you later (exits with the babka) See you later. Thats the last babka. They got the last babka. I know. Theyre going in first with the last babka. That was our babka. You cant beat a babka. We had that babka. (exhales) Theyre going to be heroes. Well what are we going to do now. If we cant get the babka the whole things useless. Well how about a carrot cake? Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You dont make carrots into a cake. Im sorry. Black Forrest? Black Forrest? Too scary. Youre in the Forrest oohh. How about a Napoleon? Napoleon? Whos he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele. That was our babka. We had that babka! Whats this one? That Cinnamon Babka. (gasp) Another babka? Theres chocolate and theres cinnamon. Well-well we got to get the cinnamon. No but they got the chocolate. Well be going in with lesser babka. I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says Oh This is so good. Whats in it? The answer invariably comes back Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not. 49? Ill have a cinnamon babka. ... and a black and white cookie for me. Peace! Thatll be 13.05 All right here you go. Yeuu. A hundred? I cant change that. You cant - huhu All right lets go. Wait a second. I can get change. Hey anybody got change for a hundred? Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! Youll get us killed! What? Dont go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us. Alright Lets go but something. Then well get some change. I am not buying something just to get change. George theres a news stand right over there. Now come on. All right what are we doing? Just get some gum or something. Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill) What is it a hundred? I cant change a hundred. Why not? You got to buy more than that. Here get a newspaper. (Kramer hands George a Newspaper) Newspaper. Not enough. Clark Bar. (Kramer starts tearing the candy wrapper open with his teeth.) Clark Bar. Keep going. Were up to two dollars here. Here George get a Penthouse Forum. Im not getting a Penthouse Forum. Why? No thatll make great dinner party conversation. Well read the letters at the dinner table. Oh thats nice. Come on did you ever read one of these? Its not real. Theyre all made up. Ohh its real. Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum newspaper gum Clark Bar. 6.75. Ah great. All right with the wine Im in over twenty dollars now. All right all right. Yes Im Sorry its a new coat. It-its Gore-Tex. You better be careful with that thing... Youll start a war. Uhm see the key to eating a Black and White cookie Elaine is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved. Well your views on race relations are just fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials) Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie. (looking in the box) Well what is this? What? Its a hair. Oh oh take it back. Lets get another one. No were late as it is. Ill just take it off. No no come on really get another one. Itll take a second. Alright alright. Excuse me. No noo no we just bought this. . . . Um you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it. You have to take a number. We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now? Well Im not going to eat a cake with a hair on it. Well it was a little hair. I took it off. A little hair? Do you think that makes it better? What if its your hair? What if its your hair? (Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head. Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out) Okay fine well just wait until she calls the number. Well maybe we should just forget about the cake? No Im bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive) All right we got the wine. Arent we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didnt bring the wine. Wed be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERES YOUR WINE? GET OUT! (reading from the Penthouse Forum) I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true... (exits to street)  A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was... L-Look at this? Ahh. Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe theres a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No no note. Can you believe this? ...well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I dont have to tell you she was a knock out.... (turns the page) I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it? No no I cant comprehend it? I mean we can put a man on the moon but were still basically very stupid. The guy whos car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what Im saying? Well yeah yeah. He could build the rocket but-but hes still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in. So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking. Yeah on one hand hes smart with rockets and on the other hand hes dumb with parking. . . . Its cold out here huh? Maybe its not even stupidity. Maybe its just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictators start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot? How about Idi Amin huh? Ill tell you if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY! Are those shoes comfortable? No not really. Cause they look comfortable. I know thats why I bought `em but theyre not comfortable. Why couldnt we just take the hair off and go? No. Thats out of the question. Whhhy? Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger. What happened? Id rather not talk about it. You cant tell me? All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out. You found a hair in your Farina? Yeah. 56 What happened? Well I started screaming Theres a hair in my farina. Theres a hair in my farina. Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE: 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site. (quietly) Wow. Whos hair was it? My mothers. (quietly) Ahhhhh 58! Ooo Thats us. (hits Jerry in the arm) Oh good. You sold us a hair with a cake around it. Wed like another one. (coughing and coughing getting really bad) Oh thats lovely. Ah Thats what you want to see yeah. . . . Yeah you want to trade your hair for some phlegm. Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade hair for phlegm. Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box) Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer? HEY DOUBLE-PARKER! (honk honk) SHOW YOURSELF. (honk honk) COME ON OUT IM FREEZING! (honk honk) We are really late now. Were in big trouble. Big trouble. Why? You know -- Elaine. What about her? . . . Im a little scared of her. Youre scared of Elaine? Yes! Why? Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it. Hey lets go inside the liquor store. Im freezin in here. Why didnt you just wear a heavier coat? Because I wanted to look good for the party. Oh Hey hey hey! Thats great! Thats very nice. You know weve been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think youre Mussolini?! I wasnt talking to you. Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing. Huh wa? Whats the matter with you? I dont know I dont feel so good. Whats wrong? My stomach I  think it was that cookie. The black and white? Yeah. Not getting along? I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there. (mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we cant look to the cookie where can we look? Oh my stomach. I feel like Im going to throw up. Wait what about your vomit streak? I know I havent thrown up since June 29th 1980. Oh oh! Ooh my god. Oh! Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why dont you watch what youre doing you LUNATIC!... (the man turns and walks away) (cont) ...uh Jerry I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Wherere you going? Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom) Do you think chickens have individual personalities? (shivering) I dont know. If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak bak baak bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. Whats the matter with you? (shivering gibberish) Waj cha jia ja Can I help you guys with anything? Oh no no no -- We bought the wine here before but now you know were bl-blocked in by some car double parked and were just waiting for the guy to pull out. Well wait outside. This isnt a hangout. But my friend here has hypothermia. (shivering) Hypothermia. All right guys take it outside. Youre paying for these. How was it? As good as it gets. You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that cheap Chardonnay. (shivering) You know Im freezin. Im definitely freezin. I cant stop shaking. Im cold too. At least youve got a coat. Lets get in the car. (quietly) L-l (look) Oh my god thats Saddam Hussein. The dictator. Can I getca anything else? Oh no thanks. How about a nice box of scram. S-s-somebody double parked we couldnt help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein were not really sure. He eh had a British accent though. What what happened to you? Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one Im going to put up your... Hey what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya What are you drunk? I had to give it to the liquor store guy. What for? I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get? Cinnamon babka. Cinnamon? Why didnt cha get chocolate? George! Here heres your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman) And your wine. See ya. See ya.]
77,5,14,[(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting? Elaine see this T-shirt six years Ive had this T-shirt. Its my best one I call him... Golden Boy. Yeah Im on the phone here. Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy! No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah Yeah Ill hold. But see look at the collar its fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer thats what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure. Why dont you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight? No!!! The reason hes the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him you break his spirit! (to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! Im so excited! Yes Im excited OK OK Ill be in soon! yeah yeah Im coming Im coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov the Russian writer!

Im not joking! ... You cant handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep] from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men) What?

Listen to this: Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on David Letterman and the Tonight Show and he did a pilot for NBC called Jerry ...that was not picked up. Georgie how come theres not anything about you in here? He cant handle the truth! All right... (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun I gotta get back to work.

Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch? Yeah let me just stop by the cash machine and Ill meet you over at the coffee shop. Yeah Im gonna get a paper. Keep your head down. Yeah!

Wow. Yeah So they took me to the hospital... Yeah... ...and they put me in this thing that feels like a coffin for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been in one of those things? You could go berserk in there! Well you have insurance... I wish! Unbelievable! Yeah. What is with this thing. (hits the organizer) I dont know it never shuts up. So anyway you could see why I would be interested in finding this person. Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that. (hits the organizer picks it up and hits it on to the table -- shouting) Stop it! Stop it! Let me have a look at this thing. Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine. Typical rich people using the world for their personal garbage can. Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button. I would like to know what my names doin in this creeps organizer to begin with. Yeah. Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow! Wha-- Oh hey. Hey great organizer you gave me. Oh you liked it huh. It wouldnt stop beeping in the car so Testikov through it out the window. Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand) I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. Im lost now Kramer. What what is it? The sand its everywhere! (blows on his arm) OK Ill see you later. Yei- Oh there you are! There you are! So? So? So what do you have to say for yourself? So what do you have to say for yourself? Why should I have anything for say for myself? War-- What is it good for?! A-Ahahahahah. Who told you? A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov the Russian writer! Hellooo! You told Testikov (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book War-- What Is IT Good For?? Uh-hu. And do you know what happened? Can I take a guess? Oh Please. Oh I dont know he threw your organizer out the window? What how did you know that? Because I know who has it. (gasps) How did you find it? Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name called me up and we met! (gasps) Where is it give it to me! I dont have it! Why not. Because shes not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill. But I didnt do it. Testikov did it he should pay for it! How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book? One million. Well thats a start. Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today. Uh-Really? Yeah but if you still look closely you can see ah a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu. Wow. But enough about fish huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know ah... architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms) You know what room Testikovs in? Yeah 308. Oh Im crazy for doing this! Well you want your organizer back dont you? Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out? Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if hes trying to hit on her! Well youre not Superman. Well youre not Lois Lane. Oh. Listen you got the tape-recorder. Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.) Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the New England Journal Of Medicine Im not gonna pay for it. Oh here she comes. Hi. Hi. Elaine this is Corinne. Hello. Hi (sighs) you got the organizer? All right lets go. Well meet you back down here in ten minutes hopefully with the money. Your parents must be so proud of you George. Oh theyre busting! Hmhm. What are those people doing over there? (In a loud and cranky voice) What Come in - come in - Come in Miss Benes! That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment? Um yes this is my friend Jerry. Um he accompanied me ya know (clears throat) single women in a big city can be dangerous so... Yeah. Th-Thats why I where these sneakers in case of any trouble -- Zip Im gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot) Yeah Yeah. The sneakers. All the Americans with the sneakers. Always running from something. Ya ya well Sit stop running Ehh. two minutes I give you latest manuscript! Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing. Hmm. (she nods in agreement) What! If you cant thing off Ill have to ask you to leave. Im waitin for two people! (takes a drag on the cigarette) Well you can wait for them outside. Yeah (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) I guess Id better. I wouldnt want to take any attention away from the hookers! All right All right. Out Out. Whatever you say Cro..w-well! Whats going on over here? There is a beached whale shes dying. Is anyone here a marine biologist? Here is latest draft. I see you next week. Same time same day. (smacks the manuscript into Elaines hand) On time please. (quietly) OK. It was nice meeting you... Aah. ... youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic) Ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief) Uh-Oh-ah by the way Mr. Testikov um do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window? (quietly) yes. How could I forget? heehe. ( laughs) Well um would you believe that it actually hit somebody in the head. Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov) Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away) (Shouting) What is that noise! Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um... Whats going on Huh! (he grabs Elaines purse) That Noise!... No No thats my purse! That Noise! No get-get off my purse! Agh its recorder! No thats... Radio! Ha! (he clicks the player off) You are spying on me! Come on! Save the whale! You gotta do it! Save the whale George... for me. So I started to walk into the water. I wont lie to you boys I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I dont know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment ... I was a Marine Biologist! George Ive just reading this thing in the paper its unbelievable! I know I was just telling them the story. Well come on George finish the story. The sea was angry that day my friends... like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli! I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said Easy big fella! And then as I watched him struggling I realized that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! Mammal. Whatever. Well then what did you do next? Well then from out of nowhere a huge tidal wave lifted me tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him (ELAINE: gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but I knew something was there... so I reached my hand in felt around and pulled out the obstruction! What is that a Titleist? (Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer) A hole in one eh. Well the-the crowd must have gone wild! Ohh yes yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1 Hm. Diane came up to me threw her arms around me... (quietly) Um-hm. ...kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that I was not a marine biologist. Wow! Whatd she say? Told me to Go to hell! and I took the bus home. All right lets go. What are you in a bad mood? Ahhh... got my laundry back. Ohhh! Golden Boy? He didnt make it. Im sorry. (pats him on the arm) Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boys son... Baby Blue. (to George) Whats with you? Sand. Its everywhere Yep.]
78,5,15,[Hum! That was really good! nan Yeah. are you full? nan Oh no Ive had just enough. nan Ah here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm delicious. Im not waiting for you. Take some. nan No thanks. nan Youre not gonna have any? nan No (with a disgusted face) Do you not like apple pie? nan No its not that. nan Well at least taste it. nan No (a resolute no) You wont even taste it? nan No. nan Come on try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing no) A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking) She wouldnt so much as taste it. Did she say why? nan No. She wouldnt say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey) Maybe shes diabetic. nan No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. nan Maybe you said something that offended her. nan The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city. nan Like at the airport? (getting excited) Yeah. nan Thats a great idea!!! nan Tell me about it! nan We could be zipping all over the place. nan They could at least try it. nan They never try anything. nan Whats the harm? nan No harm! nan (still talking to George) Im sorry. Theres no reason for her not to taste that pie. nan Who wouldnt taste a pie? nan Audrey. nan Dump her. nan Boy I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? nan (piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie. nan You did? nan He could be eating a gyro he wouldnt offer me anything. Its a sickness. nan Well I cant walk anywhere now. Im just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing? nan I got a pebble. nan Boy I never heard of that happening to a woman? nan What the hell does that mean? nan Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture) What? Why? nan Do it. Do it. This. nan Like... (doing it) Like this? nan Oh yeah! Its you! nan Whats me? nan (to the gang) Theres a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine. nan Get out! nan Its uncanny! Its like they chopped off your arms and legs dipped you in plastic and screwed you back all together again and stuck you on a pedestal. Its really quite exquisite. nan Kramer whats the name of the store with the mannequin? nan Rinitze. (he takes Jerrys spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah... (to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hells Kramer doing) Its this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on and one my couch cushions didnt have any fabric on it. nan Wait a minute Rinitze? Dont they have somme really cool suits in there? nan Real Boss! nan Im going down there. nan Im gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie and I think Im really close. Theyre all taking me out to lunch on Friday. nan (grabbing George by the arm hurried to leave) Lets go. nan All right. All right. (They both leave) (leaving too with the spatula) Are you gonna need this? nan Keep it. (implied: please) It looks exactly like me. nan Its like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Dont fall asleep Elaine. nan Whats going on here? How do you think this happened? nan Whoa look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? nan You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible? nan (european accent) You are perfect for that suit. nan You think so? nan (to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from? nan I dont know. nan You really think this looks O.K. on me? nan Fabulous. Perfect fit. And its the last one we have. nan Im sorry. You cant tell me where the mannequin came from? nan I told you I dont know. nan (irritated but still polite) Well is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know? nan Why? nan Isnt it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. nan (upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something if anobody should be rolling their eyes it is me at him about you. nan I think maybe youre flattering yourself. That mannquein is wearing a twelve hundred dollar Gaultier dress. nan What are you saying that Im not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldnt be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) Ill meet you outside. nan What is her problem? nan Ah Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag? nan Yes. nan Yes hello. Partys over. (taking off the suit) Ill tell you a little secret. Were having an unadvertised sale starting Friday that suit will be half-price. nan So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? nan Oh Im afraid I couldt do that. It wouldnt be fair to the other customers. nan Oh yes of course and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack) So I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called em up. nan Well how did they get your face? nan I dont know. They wouldnt tell me. (Jerry is not listening hes looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello? nan (Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldnt help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. nan And you waved it away. nan Did you give her a reason? nan You were full. So you gave a reason. You didnt just shake your head. nan Exactly. Youre not a psycho. Youve been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well I think we proven who the psycho is. nan We certainly have. nan Hey Elaine scratch my back. nan No way! nan Come on one lap around. nan No. nan It will be a funky adventure. nan Kramer forget it. nan Jerry how about you? nan I think you know my policy. nan Im going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier) I thought George was meeting us here? nan No hes going downtown to guard the suit. nan Hes guarding a suit? nan (the cashier; to Kramer) Do you need some help with that itch? nan Madam I pray youre not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa. nan Turn around. nan Oh all right. (Olive scratches Kramer enjoys Elaine and Jerry watch.) (makes a guy trying the suit) It fits you perfectly. nan You think so? (she nods and walks away) (outside looking the guy trying the suit through the window and thinking out loud) Whats this? Cant I leave this place for a second? (goes in take off his jacket walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you? nan Im buying the suit. nan No no no this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy) Excuse me do you work here? nan (leaving the european accent) No. (laughs) Then what the hell business is it of yours? nan Look Im doing you a favor. Theyre having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. nan Really? nan Yea Yea Yea This Monday? nan Yes. Now take off those pants. nan Actually the unadvertised sale starts on Friday. nan Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves) (to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale youre doing a lot of yapping about it. nan I cant beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here? nan Everything is delicious. nan Youve tasted them? nan Um-hmm I think almost all of them. nan Oh I see they have apple pie. nan Mmm-hmm. nan Youve had the apple pie? nan Many times. nan Audrey I got to be honest with you. Im a very curious guy. Its my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day I cant get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag youre not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind. nan Can we drop this? nan (like a frustrated child) Why cant I know? nan Ah! Poppie. nan Sweetheart hello. nan Poppie this is Jerry. nan Welcome (shakes Jerrys hand) Hello Poppie. nan Dont fill up on the bread. Im making you a very special dinner. Very special. (he leaves) The pies. Im going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves) Ah Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. Im personnaly going to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey. nan Jerry are you OK? nan Huh? nan Is anything wrong? nan No Nothing. nan You look like youve seen a ghost. nan (to another cashier) Ill see you tomorrow. nan Hey. These are for you Olive. nan Thank you. nan Ohh! nan Here it is. nan Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie this is perfect. nan (to Jerry) Well? nan Jerry have some. (Jerry shakes his head doing no) Youre not gonna taste it? (still shaking) Jerry. (still shaking) So she tought I did it to get back at her Why didnt you just tell her? nan I dont think thats the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But Ill tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough it was a wild scene. nan How could he not have washed? nan Even if youre not gonna soap up at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on do something. nan Yeah just like I do. nan You know a chef who doesnt wash is like a cop who steals. Its a cry for help he wants to get caught. nan Well I think Poppies got some problems. Theres a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it? nan We havent spoken. nan Well Im not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula) Olive? nan Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. nan Oh. You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! Shes a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight strummin the ol banjo and this wild savage free-for-all where anything can happen. nan I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes. nan Is that Elaine mannequin still there? nan Yeah. nan Yeah. The last time I saw her she was naked. nan Yeah and Poppies got problems... Where is it? Where is it? nan (George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well look at this. (innocently) This doesnt belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake. nan You bastard! You hid the suit. nan Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless I do believe I shall purchase it. nan I hope you rot in that suit. Look Im gonna get you for this. I dont know how but Im gonna get you. You are going to pay! nan Oh Ill pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. nan So I made a little list of people who mightve made the mannequin. You know possible suspects. nan Yeah all right. Go ahead. (not very interested) Theres this blind guy at a party I was at and he felt my face for a really long time. You know to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose. nan (very disinterested) Hum... ok what else you got? nan OK Im not gonna tell you the rest of the list. nan Oh because I didnt think the blind guy did it? nan Because you have an attitude. nan Oh! nan Georgio! Nice duds! nan Youre telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So what do you think? nan Did you hear something? nan Yeah like a swoosh. nan Yeah. nan (feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. Its rubbing between you thighs when you walk. Thats whats making that swooshy sound. nan I probably didnt hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! nan So what? What would they care? nan This MacKenzie hes a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. nan So you think youre not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise? nan Lets say it comes down to me and one other guy. Hes got a nice quiet suit and Im whooshing all over the place! Who do you think hes gonna hire? nan You know I think all these interviews are making you nuts. nan Hey Jerry I saw your girlfriend was in here before. nan Audrey? nan Yep. Sat down had herself a piece of pie. nan Was it apple? nan What else? nan This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! nan Do I know you? nan Hmm... No you dont. nan Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with points. nan The mannequin! nan Oh I got to see this thing. nan Boy the resemblance is uncanny. nan You think you can pose me however you want? Thats my ass in your window! nan Its our store and our mannequin we can do whatever we want with it. nan No! You take that mannequin down right now or Im pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes this is my attorney. nan (to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking? nan Well I believe theres some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney Uh-huh The Charlie Macarthy hearings. nan Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? nan Im getting the manager. (she leaves) Jerry get the car. (shes getting the mannequin) What are you doing? nan Just get the car! nan Elaine as your legal counsel I must advise against this. nan I dont know about you but Im getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright Im dropping you off at work right? nan Where are you going? nan Poppies Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of control (Georges pants are making noise) phones ringing people running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking George too) Did you hear something? nan No I didnt hear anything. nan Huh thats strange. (they start walking again) Its quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he stops again George too) That sound again. Sure you didnt hear anything? nan No cant say as I did. nan Kind of like a... rustling. nan Could be the leaves... Thats right. Poppies on 77th. Ok well see you at 8:00. Bye-bye. nan Hello. nan What are you doing here? nan So how was the pie? nan What pie? nan The apple pie you had today at Monks Im very busy here. nan Pretty good wasnit? I told you you shouldve tasted it. nan You better not let Poppie see you here. nan All right Im looking for someone named Poppie. nan Uh who are you? nan Board of health weve had several complaints. nan Oh about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands) Are you Poppie? nan Im Poppie. nan I think youd better come with me. nan Whats the problem? nan What do they want from Poppie? nan Well Poppies a little sloppy. nan You taught Id care about your pants wooshing? nan I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. nan No no no. He got fired because he wasnt a team player. Thats something we dont joke about at MacKenzie. Youll find were team here George. We dont tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way youre in the wrong place. nan No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. nan Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house. nan Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert. nan (to George) The chef said that he made it special for you. nan Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant: its Bob!) Mmm.. Best pie Ive ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George shakes his head doing no) Well take a bite. Its delicious. (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking) If youre one of us youll take a bite. nan So you didnt get the job. nan No. But I was the only one at the table that didnt get violently ill. nan Kramer you cant keep avoiding her like this youre gonna have to say something. nan What am I supposed to say? nan Tell her you lost your itch. nan What happened to your itch? nan I lost it two days ago. Ive been faking it so I wouldnt hurt her feelings. nan Well you should tell her. nan Ill let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramers back) No no. No more of that. Theres something I have to tell you. nan What? nan Uh well theres someone else. nan Someone else? nan Yeah yeah yeah... Who is she? nan Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerrys car) her? nan Yeah there she is. Thats my gal. nan Youre a liar. Ive seen her in here before. Shes not your girlfriend. nan Now Olive look Im sorry. nan Why is she wearing her underwear? nan Well its the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well I guess were gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that. nan Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? nan No. Thats one for the ages. But I think theyre gonna put Poppie away for a long long time. nan You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if therere more. Where are they coming from? nan Ricky weve been getting a tremendous response to your TR-6 mannequin. nan TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine. nan]
79,5,16,[Its just not good its not good. Its not good. Im bored. Shes boring Im boring were both boring. We got out to eat we both read newspapers. Well at breakfast everybody reads. No. Lunch we read dinner we read. You read during lunch? Ya Oh well. Theres nothing to talk about. Ya whats there to talk about. Well at least you and I are talking about how theres nothing to talk about. Why dont you talk to her about how theres nothing to talk about? She knows there is nothing to talk about. At least youll be talking. Oh shut up. Hey look whos here. Hey Al. Hey Al. Hows it going? (extremely happy) Deeply in love. We have soo many things to talk about. Sometimes well talk all night till the sun comes up (pauses in his happiness; to George) so how about you? Oh Im seeing someone yes. You know her Daphne Bower. Great girl. We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks. Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower. (to Jerry) Oh did you hear about Fulton? Ya. I went by the hospital to see him a few days ago (looking at Jerry) think hed really like you to come visit. Me? Ya he said he could use a good laugh. What about me? (to George) He didnt mention you. (Looks toward the front of the bus) This is my stop. Uh see ya. Ya Ya see ya. Deeply in love. If you cant say anything bad about a relationship you shouldnt say anything at all. (points to George) Ya. I didnt even know Fulton was in the hospital. Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on come with me. Na no Im not good in these situations. I cant hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse. Oh stop it. Ya and also Im afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care? So youre not gonna come? No but say hello for me. Hey! Hey! Hey Mick. Hey Jerry. Whats doing? Nothing whats doing with you? Same old same old. George this is Mickey. Hi nice to meet you. Pleasure. Hows work going you guys? Lets not even talk about it. (to Kramer) You got a job? Ya Mickey. He hooked me up. Were stand-ins for the actors on All My Children. Mickey hes a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father. (to Jerry then both Jerry and George) But I got a big problem. The kid I stand in for hes growing. He was four feet last month now hes like four-two and a half. He shot up two and a half inches. I can do four-two four-three is a stretch any higher than that and Im gonna be out on my ass doing that para-legal crap. How do you stop a kid from growing? (to Mickey) I told you you should offer him some cigarettes. I offered him cigarettes (to Jerry and George) but his stupid mother is hanging around. She wont let him have any. (to Mickey) What about lifts? (to Kramer) Out of the question. (to Mickey) Cant you just switch with another Midget? (turns and moves up to George points his finger at him) Its little people you got that? Easy Mickey easy. Yap.. Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing? Im going to the hospital to visit Fulton. (on his way to the door) Oh oh well say hello for me. Now look were going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes. Lifts?! Look Kramer you dont understand this kind of thing is just not done. You wanna keep your job dont you? Ya but.. YAH! No Buts Kramer (with his hand in Mickeys face) YAAAAAH! Hey woahoh Fulton. Its me. Hey Jerry good to see ya. I could really use a good laugh. Who couldnt. I havent cracked a smile in months. Oh dont worry youll crack. Crackings inevitable first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked it wasnt a very happy time... because of the war famine plus it was cold very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isnt a good time for a visit. Its a fine time. Oh alright ah well... Theres a priest a minister and a rabbi and theyre all staring at him.... (sets down his paper) So how were the eggs? Eggs are eggs. (Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha I dont think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne (correcting George) Daphne. Daphne. I have to tell you something this is very difficult... (interrupts and hurriedly puts down her paper) Oh I forgot to tell you. Al Netchie called me today. Ya ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say? He told me not to get involved with you. What? Ya he said you could never make a commitment to any one and youd just wind up (reaches out and lightly slaps Georges hand) hurting me. He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that. Is it true? Of course not. I mean sure there may have been one or two occasions in the past when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner but those days are well behind me. How long are you going to be away for Daddy? Im not really going away I told you Ill be back every other weekend. Dont go Daddy dont go. Now Porter you know your mother and I love you very much but sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug. (walks into the scene) ...and theres your scene. Stand-ins Yo Alright you guys get on their spots so we can fix the lights. (taps the Father on the shoulder) Thats good work. (quickly with no acting) How long you going to be away for Daddy? (trying to act like the guy playing the Father) Im not really going away I told you Id be back every other weekend. (tugs on Kramers coat) Dont go Daddy dont...go. Now listen Porter you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug. Ah! (pauses for the hug) Alright (Kramer still holding on) Alright! Kramer! (pushes Kramer off him) Ok everybody thats lunch... one hour. How do those lifts feel? Quiet. Hi guys. Hey Tammy. Hey you look different. Have you been working out? (looks at Kramer) Not that I know of. Well whatever it is youre doing keep doing it you look great. How about lunch? OH I cant today but um I see it our future. (starts to leave) See ya Kramer. Ya.

So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then theyre steaming hot and theyre burning his hands see so he... hes juggling em (does juggling motions) hes jugglin em jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing stone faced) It was really really funny. Hey Jerry. Hey Phil how you doing? You look terrific. I got my health. Well thats the most important thing. (to Fulton) Hey how ya doing Fulton! Octane Butane Nitrane! (Fulton looks at him still stone faced and not amused. To Jerry) Hows he doing? (wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs. You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza. I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya? (on the speaker) Ya Ya. (hits the button opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys. Do I know him? No but Ill tell you something. Of all the guys I know I could envision you going out with him. If you were a woman would you go out with him? If I was a woman Id be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in. (laughs) Ya I bet you would. Alright give him my number. Alright. This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie that pimple. Tells Daphne not get this Not to get involved with me. What? Ya. Thats what she told me. Why? Because hes afraid shes gonna get hurt. Is she? Of course. So? Wa.. He doesnt have to tell her. Maybe he likes her. Oh no no no. Hes deeply in love and I was just about to break up with her when she told me. So what are you gonna do? Well I cant break up with her now. Why? Because he said I was going to. So now youre going to keep going out with her for spite? Yes I am. Ya I could see that. I dont see any way around it. No me either. What choice do I have? None. Fultons wife told me its all my fault. She said since my visit hes taken a turn for the worse. Did you tell him the Packyderm story? (yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story! Maybe I outta go over there. Towards what end? Im very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout I moved into his hospital room for three days the doctors were amazed at his recovery. Hey. Hey Mick. (to Kramer) Johnny Vigiano went through my locker. YAOH! (slamming the door) That little Bastard! He saw the lifts in my shoes. He knows Im heightening.

Oh hes always been jealous of me. I always get to stand in for the bigger stars; The Cosby Kids Ricky Schroder Macaulay Culkin. (whistles) Whats he like huh? Hes a good kid. Ya? So what does he care if you put lifts in? You dont understand. Theres an unwritten code about this kind of thing. I could be ostracized. I remember when I was a kid some guy tried to heighten. He lost his job lost his friends Everything. Oh I knew I was crazy to try this kind of thing but I was so desperate. (pauses laying on the couch; jumps up) What is this kid taking anyway? Hormones? Steroids? Would you tell me!? George tomorrows Sunday. We could sleep late and get the paper and half breakfast and spend the morning together go for a long walk maybe do a little shopping have lunch... (interrupts her) You know what. I dont think Im going to be able to stay over tonight. Why not? I I really should go home. Ya.. actually Im planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) were uh were going to a father-son picnic just the two of us. I thought we were going to spend the day together. Well Dads been planning this for such a long time he bought a new blanket and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs) Have you given any more thought to what we talked about? You know moving in? Yes oh yes very much. Maybe you dont want to move in. No no I do. You know its just... (interrupting him) Maybe Al Netchie was right maybe I shouldnt have gotten involved with you. (angry that she believes Al was right) No hes not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright Im canceling the father-son picnic. I dont know what hes gonna do with all that potato salad. (Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold em. I mean hes like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza you know ah. And then they go flying out of... (dying of laughter) Im peeing in my pants.

So you were talking (Elaine makes an agreement sound mmm) youre having pleasant conversation (Elaine makes an agreement sound mmm) then all of sudden... Yea. It. It. Out. Out. Well I I cant believe this. I know Phil he hes a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be? Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with? Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola? (to Kramer) He took it out. Maybe uh it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air they cant breathe in there. Its in human. So shes just sitting there shes having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden. It. It. Out. Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright Hey come on get out of here Dophne gonna be here any minute. Alright Im going. You know what Ive come to realize? Im not just bored. I genuinely dislike her. Well how long you are going to keep this up? Hey Ill get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again. You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. Id be happy to set-up a meet and greet. Im very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still dont know what makes me tick. Yes I do. What are you doing? Im going to the hospital to see Fulton.

So Tammy finally todays our big lunch. I dont think so. Why not? What the hell are you talking about? Look Mickey everybody knows that youre heightening. Its all over the set. Wait wait (goes to grab her arm) (recoils) Dont touch me. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. All the progress we made over the years and you go and blow it by pulling a stupid stunt like this. Wait a second wait a second you got me all wrong. It was all because of the kid. (numerous little people begin to crowd around them) (to Tammy) The kid was growing. He shot up two and a half inches in a month. (to all the little people) I woulda lost my job. Any one of you would have done the same. You got no right! Im Mickey Abbott! I stood in for Punky Bruster when all of you was nothing. (seeing the crowd still doesnt agree with what he did he points at Kramer) Its all his fault. (Kramer acts like he doesnt know what Mickey is talking about) It was his idea. Come on Johnny lets go get something to eat. (in complete disgust as seeing Tammy leave with Johnny) AH! (turns and looks at Kramer) AH! What? AH! Mickey! This guys belching out vitamins.. (dying of laughter and coughing) Stop. (cont) and this whole justice league Batman Green Lantern Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman cant cover everything? (still laughing and coughing) Stop. For crying out loud Hes Superman. (Fulton stops laughing Jerrys face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton? George first let me just say Ive never been with a guy who was so committed to commit. I mean its so rare in men these days an thats what makes this all the more difficult. (happily) Difficult? The other day after work some girlfriends and I went to a bar for some drinks and there was this crazy mishap and I wound up meeting someone as a result. George... (acting disappointed) Oh please dont. Uh Im sorry. Im afraid the worst of it is its someone you know. Jerry Persheck. Packyderm? Heh he was carrying these two pieces of pizza...]

But his lower lip landed well below my rim. Ohhh moisture? Yeah. Definite moisture. Thats an open-lip kiss alright. Yeah. Listen I think hes giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds Elaine answers it.) Yeah? Oh uh...its George. Hey what happened to you? Nothing...little problem. Well what was it? I mean I was waiting. Can I come upstairs please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.) I mean maybe he wants to ask me out. I dont know why youre interested in this guy hes a jerk. Because he doesnt pay any attention to me and uh he ignores me. Yeah so? I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm what happened? Nothing I... said it was a little problem. Yeah? What was it? Well...I was in the locker room showering and I...I had to go so... Here we go. Anyway I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look. You went...in the shower? Yeah so what? Im not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.) Do you go in the shower? No never. Do you? I take baths. Well what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back? Did you ever hear of...holding it in? Oh no...no thats very bad for the kidneys. How do you know? Medical journals! Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone elses urine? Hello. Oh hi...honey. What are you doing here? I just thought Id drop off a few things. Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go Marty.

What are you talking about? Uh...I got married. You got married? I wasnt invited? Nobody sends me an invitation? Well it was sudden. Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you? No no it was a small ceremony. Havent I always been a good uncle? Yes yes you have. Who told you when you went to school that you print well? You did you did. When he was younger he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print. Im a good printer. I remember your V. It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa theres my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait! Uncle Leo wait! Im glad youre here. This can get really boring. Do you know where I can get some good olives? I can find out. Would ya? Sure. (thinking) Ooh a project. Thats a definite signal. By the way you look really great in that leotard. Oh thanks. (thinking) Thats no signal who wouldnt like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard. Hey you know whats weird?

Can I have a sip of your water? Oh yeah sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.) Thanks. (Is about to take a drink but wipes the neck of the bottle with his shirt first.) (shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God. Im sorry what were you saying? Oh it was nothing for-forget it. (George enters the gym.) See that guy right there? Yup you mean him? I caught him urinating in the shower. Im thinking about turning him in too. Honey? Could you get me something to drink? Youre right there. Cmon Im sitting! (Jerry walks to the kitchen annoyed. Meryl laughs at the TV show shes watching.) Honey whatd you do with the can opener? I didnt do anything with it. Well its not here it was here yesterday. Its in the first drawer. Im looking in the first drawer. Its not here. Yes it is. Hey...Im not stupid. Im looking in that drawer theres no can opener. Did I say you were stupid? Well wouldnt I have to be? You tell me theres a can opener in the drawer Im looking in the drawer theres no can opener - what other conclusion could one reach? (The phone rings.) Do you want me to go find it? Yes. I do. You show me where theres a can opener in that drawer. (Answers the phone.) Hello! Im sorry Im just fighting with my wife. Jerry we just heard whats going on? Why the hell didnt you tell us?

(To his parents) Listen Im gonna have to call you later. Well I give up. Well whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.) Got any coffee? Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen trips and falls onto the kitchen floor.) Ill get it Ill get it! Take it easy why are you so tired? My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry I cant sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So last night I turn up the heat - its too hot. I open up a window - its too cold. (Frantic) I cant get into a zone! What is that? (Points to Kramers pocket as Meryl comes back.) Huh? That? Oh I forgot. (Hands back Jerrys can opener.) Hey Im sorry about all that can opener stuff. Yeah me too. I Love you. I Love you. Well goodnight. Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.) They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them! So what do you want me to do? Talk to him! How can I do that? You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss! Yes but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water! Well that doesnt mean anything! Are you kidding? Thats very significant! If he was interested in me hed want my germs! Hed just crave my germs! Shes right George. Bottle-wipe is big. Well what about the open-lipped kiss? (still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it. Yeah youre right youre right. (To Elaine) Alright maybe hes not interested but you still know him - cant you just ask him? George...but if I ask him now I will have no chance of going out with him. Why? I...I dont know... Aha. Aha. Could it be because you dont want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower is that it?! No thats not it! Oh I think it is! I think thats exactly what it is! Why couldnt you just wait? I was there! I saw a drain! Since when is a drain a toilet?! Its all pipes! Whats the difference?! Different pipes go to different places! Youre gonna mix em up! Ill call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.) Alright can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here? Okay! Okay! Okay I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.) Jerry I think that quilt is ready. Alright. Well you gotta pick it up for me! Alright Ill pick it up but its the last time Im doin it! Im so tired! Boy you dont look good. Huh? I dont? No you look pale. Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Annas parents today! (The phone rings.) Hello? Oh hi honey. (annoyed weary) Yes I told him. Ill get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay Im sorry... Im sorry its not ready yet. (Kramer bursts in.) Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here? Who the hell are you? Huh Its not your quilt. Hes a very good friend of mine hes kindve like an older brother to me...when things dont go right he kinda takes it personally. Well uh...maybe tomorrow. Maybe. Oh its okay itll be okay. Alright Im gonna see you later. Where you goin? I gotta meet Annas parents today remember? I look terrible! Im gonna hit the tanning machines. I cant believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya. Hey thats how I maintain my glow. Im goin home. Ya. Excuse me? Uh how much would it cost to clean this? Oh about thirteen dollars. Thirteen? Well I cant afford that. Well Im sorry. Hi Greg. Hey Elaine. Ill be off in a second. Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.) Oh well Its all yours. (Walks away. Elaine looks at the machine then George runs over.) What happened? Did he bring it up? Never mind that look at the signal I just got. Signal? What signal? Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next he didnt wipe his sweat off. Thats a gesture of intimacy. Ill tell you what that is - thats a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And youre my witness! Listen George! Listen! He knew what he was doing this was a signal. A guy leaves a puddle of sweat thats a signal? Yeah! Its a social thing. What if he left you a used Kleenex whats that a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if hes thinking of turning me in that I got the goods on him! No! I wont be a party to this. So youre gonna let me get suspended for shower urination? Okay Ill talk to him. But youre putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.) I wont let you do this! I want to! But it isnt right! I cant. Give me the clothes. Jerry please. What about her? Oh the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second then follows her and catches up to her on the street.) No Jerry please! Im not gonna let you walk out of my life. I cant fight you. (They embrace and kiss passionately.) Do you want box or hanger? You decide. (Jerry considers.) Youre really working up quite a sweat today huh? Yeah. (Spies the shapely manager of the health club.) Oh theres the manager. Good. I think Im gonna talk to her about that guy you know we cannot have people like that in here. Are you sure you want to do that? Yeah. Hes disgusting! Besides Ill take any chance I can to talk to her. Youre interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.) Very. Ah. You know uh..Im engaged. (preens) Yep gettin married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.) Oh good there he is. I wanna be able to point him out. You know Greg I wouldnt do that if I were you. Why? Well correct me if Im wrong but isnt it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it? Oh I see...youre friends with the urinator arent you? Yeah well at least he had a drain. Here you go Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount it comes to $17.80. Here you go. (Pays Marty then looks at the clothes on the hanger.) Excuse me this isnt mine. Oh yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself. Really? (Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.) Thank you. (Exits.) Thats him! (Opens the door. Kramer stands there deeply tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.) You son of a bitch! Im sorry. Who is she? I want to know who she is. It doesnt matter. I want a divorce. A divorce? Oh so you can marry her and give her the discount? Yes thats right. What happened to us Jerry? Ill tell you what happened. We got married. Im sorry uh.. this is my fault. I pushed it on you. No. I guess I just wasnt ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage. Goodbye Jerry. Oh I forgot...(reaches in her purse)...this is your maple syrup. Its alright I want you to have it. (sentimental) Okay thanks. Well always have...pancakes. Bye Jerry. (Exits.) I thought you said you was bringin a white boy home! I dont see a white boy! I see a damn fool!]
81,5,18,[You know their timing couldnt be worse. Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you? You dont understand I havent been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road then my parents show up Im getting a little uh backed up. When are they leaving for Paris? Not for another three days. What about her place? She lives with her parents.

Well no not yet you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-Ill reimburse you of course. Why are you doing this? He wants this guy to think hes in Paris. Why? Because George is a deeply disturbed individual. Oh hey Helen uh Could I uh use some more of your hand lotion? I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion) (putting on the lotion) Ya Its from the Saks Fifth Avenue in Miami. Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) Im gonna remember that if Im ever in Florida.

(walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what do you say? W-well I dont think so Aaron uh I have plans. Oh. (getting into Jerrys face) How about you Jerry? Im swamped. You sure? You could examine the art work up close. Maybe Ill try and catch up with you. (under her breath) Ya thatll happen) (Moving toward the door) Alright. Were off. Ok bye. Bye. Ok buh bye. Have a good time. Bye. See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door blowing Elaine a kiss) Ok. Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum? I dont know. What is that? Maybe he was just trying to be nice. Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this? Wait a second he just did me a big favor. What? (dialing) He got em out of the house. What? Call Rachel. Oh. (on the phone) ah no I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed) (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal wish I could help you out. Theyre not coming? No they had plans. How could they have plans? Thats what I wanna know. Well what difference does it make? They wouldnt lie to us theyre are dear friends. What am I supposed to do with all this Paella? They said tomorrow maybe. Maybe? Maybe they dont like us. Why wouldnt they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for? Ah keep quiet. What are you trying to set my mouth on fire? I dont know what the reason could be. (disappointed) Oh Hi hi. Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had. Aaron is quite the tour guide. Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings? Oh sure like Monet. Dont you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean know body would paint like that if they could see. Its all out of focus. Well hes from the impressionist school you know like Monet Manet Tippi Tippi Dayday. I say the guy was painting without his glasses. (answering phone) Hello? Rachel ya uh no theyre back. Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here and read. Uh haha ya well uh Im sorry too Ill call you later ok bye (hangs phone up) Well I should be going. Oh thanks again. Buh bye. Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) Ive heard about you. You must be Aaron Ive heard about you. (Laughing) Well see you later. Yeah. (leaving) Bye Bye So uh what are you guys doing for dinner? We have no plans. (noticing Kramers coat) Look at that Helen do you see what hes wearing? Thats the Executive. Now what is Executive? The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it. I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic these havent been made in twenty years. Why would they? Know body bought them then. Hes wearing one. Yea these are a hot item over at Rudys. You dont say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage in Florida? Get em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-Ill take care of everything. You gotta deal. Yaaaa. This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson. Ill call Jack Klompus hes got a key to the garage. He can send them overnight delivery. Youre gonna first start shipping boxes? Were leaving for Paris in three days. Hell send them express. Youre crazy. Ill tell you how crazy I am Im gonna pay for this whole trip with these coats. N-na Im paying for the trip. So much the better. Anyway its kind of a fluke thing but uh Ill be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there. Paris huh? Yea ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but its jus..its a great business opportunity. I-I dont even know how long Im gonna be away for. Where will you stay? An apartment complex the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh youll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again Im sorry. George you have no idea how fantastic this is. Fantastic? Ya weve been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives in Paris. But hes afraid to fly alone you know hes kinda withdrawn but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So its a perfect solution. How gee what a coincidence. And youll send me a postcard. Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected to the way he painted children. Mm hmm. And that Morty Ill tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him Aaron Yes? Uh let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? Well they were in from out of town I thought they would enjoy it. Uhuh um you didnt feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age? No it was fun. You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld. Yea they bought me a coke. So howd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat? I came home one night and I tripped over one of Jerrys toys. (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So I took out my belt just to threaten him and I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror. How serendipitous. So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born. Mmm He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on lets play. Did you call Jack Klompus yet? I havent been able to reach him. Hey Ill call him right now. Ah come on. Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone) Jerry have you seen Schindlers List? No I havent seen it yet. Oh you have to go you have to Im going You have to Ok (on the phone) Hello Jack. Ya Its Morty Who died? Know body died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of boxes. What boxes? Im gonna explain what boxes. Alright how the hell do I know? Anyway there are these three big boxes you cant miss them. I want you to ship them here to New York for me. I thought youre going to Paris Im still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here. Whats in the boxes? Raincoats. Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think youre gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? Thats garbage. I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes. When do you want these? Send them tomorrow. You think theyre coming tonight? I dunno they said maybe. Of course theyre coming theyre leaving soon. If they dont come tonight they might not see us. Well they better come I got all this Paella. I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip maybe a cruise. Yes a cruise a long cruise just the two of you. Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night? I-I wasnt in the attic. I heard noise. Maybe it was a mouse. (jumping to his feet) OK thats it! Were moving! What? I will not tolerate infestation. You havent even seen one. Dont you understand the very thought the very idea Ill never be comfortable again. Alright Frank thats enough. I guess Ive been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldnt accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing) Uh huh. They will get a good home wont they? Look I gotta be honest with you theres nothing here too spectacular. Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance he was a very handsome man a casanova really. Ill give you uh two-hundred dollars for the three boxes. Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling. Yea Im in a good mood here. Thank you. Hey George what are you doing here? Uh Im just selling some of Dads things (looking into Kramers eyes) thats what he would have wanted. Oh I gotcha (clicks) (leaving) Thatll do. Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and I are going into business together selling raincoats. Hey thats swell. Yea we worked it out all over dinner last night. Dinner? (grabs Kramer) Ya. You had dinner with the Seinfelds? Yea last night. Was this something you had planned for a while? No it was a spur of the moment. Well you know Morty likes to fly by the seat of his vintage pants. (hurriedly leaves Rudys) They had plans They had plans! Oooo boy Ive never seen these before (looking at the clothes George just sold Rudy) Well they just came in part of my spring-time cruise collection. Two for twenty-five dollars. Oh Ill take these. Alright Hey remember this raincoat that you sold me? Sure thats the Executive. Ya you have any others? I wish they dont make em anymore. Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition would you be interested? Very interested Cuz theyre coming in from Florida as we speak. Well bring em in. So youll buy them? I dont see what would possibly stop me. Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans! What are you talking about? Mom and Pop Seinfeld Look I dont know. Alright I happen to know what they did last night they had dinner with Kramer. Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing. So whats the deal they dont want to have dinner with my parents? Thats right. Is there something wrong with my parents? Absolutely Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people. These the people you currently live with? Yes. Uh huh So are they coming tonight or not? Look I really dont know what theyre plans are. Ok fine. Its going to be very interesting very interesting if they dont show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella. What is that anyway? Its a spanish dish. Its a moulage of fish an meat with rice. Very tasty. I-Ill tell em Hey could you do one other thing for me? Name it. You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kids father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as theyre going (claps) So you thought as long as theyre mailing postcards it wouldnt be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who theyve never seen through the streets of Paris? (pause) Alright if you think its too much they dont have to mail the postcards. So wheres he taking you? Well first were going to a matin&eacute;e Im taking the afternoon off were gonna go see My Fair Lady and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places. You are one lucky girl. (Elaine laughs in happiness) Wish I could find a nice guy. (Joanne goes to leave; Aaron enters) Hi Aaron. (getting up in Aarons face) Hey Joanne. (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) Hey (already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi Hello Hello. Hello Elaine I was able to finagle two more tickets to My Fair Lady and I thought why not ask Morty and Helen. Oh Great. (looking around) This is some office. Whats the square footage? You dont mind to you Elaine? Mind? Oh o-of course not. We can make a whole day of it. This is some building Harry Fleming used to have an office here. There was a deli on the first floor. You dont get corned beef like that anymore. What happened to that deli? (somewhat annoyed) I really dont know Mr. Seinfeld (stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-Theyre gonna be here any second. When are they leaving? In two days. Its been soo long. I know. Ok its only two more days. Right Thursday three oclock.

My Fair Lady When did you get tickets to see that? Aaron surprised us and Elaine came. Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting. We saw Regis Philbin get out of a limousine. Oh. He looks better on TV. Oh (answering phone) Hello? Hello Jerry Yea. Its Jack Klompus. Oh hi Jack. So when are you coming down to Florida again? As soon as is humanly possible. You know I still got that pen the one that writes upside down. Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it. So uh wheres your father? Ya hes right here. Yea Morty listen I cant get into the garage. What do you mean? There is something wrong with the key. The key doesnt work You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen minutes. Tell him to come down here and get his own packages. You have nothing better to do then worry about his boxes. You gotta pull on the knob as you turn it. Get the hell outta here with your knob. What does he want from you? My idiot son could open that garage door. What did I do? Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need it. Theyll be here first thing Thursday morning. Thursday morning? You know were leaving at three oclock. (in a hurry) Yea youre leaving at three oclock. How are you gonna get all this done in time? Dont worry about it. (in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time? They were drinking champaign in a buggy! First Kramer then Elaine? Yea Its a slap in the face. (with her arms out in wonder) What did we ever do to them? (George puts his arms out and imitates Estelle as she moves her arms up and down as she speaks) I want to know what we did them! What are they too good for us? A raincoat salesman I could buy and sell em like that. The hell with them. (in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most is the lying. Lets forget about it. Were going on a beautiful vacation. (sits down in his chair) (sitting down) Vacation? Youre mother and I are planning on taking a cruise. (claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle) But I cant find any vacation clothes. They were in the attic. The attic? Y-you havent wore any of those clothes for years. How can I go on a cruise with out my cabana wear? I love those those clothes. (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes off into another room with glass doors on it and shuts the door) (picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) Its the remote. (looking from the room; you can see him through the glass) Where the hell are my clothes? I love those clothes. Lousy moth ridden crap. Hey. Hey Jerry. So how was the movie? Oh really good really good. And didnt the three hours go by just like that (snaps her fingers) Like that (snaps his fingers) What about the end with the list? Ya that was some list. What did you think about the black and white? (confused) The black and white. The whole movie was in black and white. Oh yea I didnt even realize. You dont even think about it theres so much going on. Ya ya I tell ya I could see it again. So Klompus has the key but the jerk couldnt open it up. All you gotta do it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) jus get it in there (jiggling making a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle reiggle Look I find this whole thing very uninteresting. When you get the coats come in. Hey what again? Im trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella. Paella ya Ill be there. Apparently the Seinfelds are too good for us. I shouldnt say anything bad about your uh your partner. No no you know were not partners. I only get twenty-five percent. Twenty-five percent? It was your idea. Yap I know. Youre doing all the leg work. Thats right Hes ripping you off Youre right hes ripping me off If anybody should be getting more its you. Hes ripping me off Well dont let him take advantage of you like that. YAH! (exits) (coming out of the back-room noticing George) Oh its you? Youre the one who sold me the moth ridden cabana crap. You know Ive been thinking why is Kramer getting twenty-five percent? Well he told you about the place. So what why is that worth twenty-five percent? Its a finders fee. You know what a finders fee is? You find something you get a fee. Finders fee is ten percent and no more. Well its too late now. Those are my coats. I saved them I stored them Ive been waiting years for this pay off. Well youre not gonna say anything. Ive been thinking about something. Ya so have I Ahh! I dont think the deal is fair. You dont think its fair. No no I found the place I set the whole thing up Im doing all the leg work. What leg work? Oh theres leg work. If anything youre getting too much. Too much?! Thats right theyre my coats. Look I want thirty-five percent. Im thinking more like fifteen. No way Im taking fifteen. Well youre not getting thirty-five. Alright lets compromise. Twenty-five percent. Ok its a deal Moths are a discourage to my business all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. You know what happens to the larvae? They hatch and theyre everywhere. Im sorry umm he-heres your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-Ill have the clothes. (counting the money to make sure its all there) Its already put a dent in my fumigation bill. So uh where are the clothes? I burned em. Oh. Thats good. N-I know theyre your parents Jerry an theyre very nice people. But dont you think its odd that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone elses parents are enjoying themselves? I mean dont you find that abnormal? It is a tad askew. I mean theyre your parents and you dont do anything. So why is this stranger doing it? Ive hardly been out to dinner with them. See See I cant even say anything you know because all hes really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice this is like certifiably nice. Youre right hes insane. Yes hes insane thats what I think. So what are you going to do? I dont know I dont know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie? Uh from what I saw it was pretty good. Ya what do you mean from what you saw? Well I um I didnt ah actually get to see the whole movie. Yea why not? I was kind of um (pauses) making out. (thinks for a second) You were making out during Schindlers List? I couldnt help it. We hadnt been alone in a long time it just got the better of me. During Schindlers List? (trying to justify it) Were both living with our parents. Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything? No I dont think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me. Oh. Hello Mrs. Seinfeld (like Jerry) Hello Newman. Jerrys not here. (goes to shut the door on him) Uh ah (stops her from closing the door; walks in) Having a nice trip? (walks over grabs a junior mint smells it then puts it in his pocket) Wonderful we went to the theater last night. Oh the theater. Because I was wondering. Wondering what? Why I didnt see you at Schindlers List with Jerry. Well we already saw it. Oh well its a good thing for Jerry that you didnt go. (getting up from the table and coming over) Why is that? Well he really seemed to have his hands full if you know what I mean. Im afraid I dont. Him and his little buxom friend Rachel were going at it pretty good in the balcony. What? What do I have to spell it out for ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers into Poland. Jerry was necking during Schindlers List? Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot recall. Anyway I just really came up to get some detergent. Jerry sends his laundry out. (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice seeing you folks and a by the way you didnt hear this from me. Tata (runs down the hallway laughing) Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do? How could you? How could I what? You were making out during Schindlers List? What? No. Dont lie Jerry. (turns) Newman. How could you do such a thing? I couldnt help it. We hadnt been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew the war was over. (answering the phone) Hello. Hello Jerry its Jack Klompus. Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad its Klompus. Hello Hello Morty listen that key doesnt work. Its no good. You didnt get in? Oh I got in I had to break the window with a rock and then I got my hand all cut up reaching in. You broke the window? He broke the window? You wanted those damn boxes didnt you? (off camera) He should be on his hands and knees thanking you. Did you send them? Yea theyll be there tomorrow afternoon two oclock. Tomorrow afternoon? Tomorrow afternoon? Tomorrow afternoon? I told you to send them express. W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in the afternoon than the morning I figured what the hells the difference. So what did you do about the window? I gotta fix your window now? Alright alright goodbye. (Morty hangs up the phone Jack hangs up the phone) I dont think we are gonna make that flight. W-what do you mean youre not making the flight? We have to make the flight were with a charter group. If we dont the trip is off. Well whats the difference well go some place else. Some place else? What about Paris? You dont understand Ive come this far I cant stop now. I cant believe that youre doing all this just to sell some stupid raincoats. You dont understand fashion is cyclical this thing could come back. I think youre out of your mind. I just dont understand how all those clothes can disappear. Moths? Moths ate three boxes? Well you know what happens with larvae hatch they-theyre everywhere. You know I was thinking today. I never liked those Seinfelds anyway hes an idiot all together. (Knocking at the door) Ah theres Kramer. (from outside) Hello? Hello (still outside) Helowwwowwow (Estelle opens the door) Hey (kisses Estelle hello) Ha ha Good evening (George waves) Hope youre hungry. (goes into the kitchen) Ooo Paella Hey uh let me take youre coat. (giving George his coat) Oh ya thanks buddy. That shirt whered you get that shirt? Wha? Thats my cabana shirt you stole my shirt you son of a bitch! (really fast) George you let your friends go up in my attic and steal my clothes? (grabbing at the shirt) Gimme that back (trying to get away) woah Dad?! (laughs as Frank ends up tickling him; gets away) I bought it from Rudy. Rudy?! That skunk I knew he didnt burn those clothes. Whos Rudy? What clothes? I sold your clothes yesterday. You sold my clothes (smacks George on the forehead) what do you mean you sold my clothes? I didnt think you wore them anymore. Its cruise wear! Kramer I love that shirt. Yaya THATS BECAUSE ITS MINE!! You look just like Frank on our honeymoon. Oh well thank you. Whos this Rudy? Well Rudys the guy buying Mortys raincoats. Morty Seinfeld? Hes a bum. Well the whole deal going down tomorrow. Mortys gonna miss his plane for it. Missing his plane? Wasnt that a charter flight? Yea. What happens to charter tickets when you dont use em? Well I suppose they are wasted. Yes I suppose they are. Tomorrow Im going straight down to this Rudy and get my clothes. A mouse! You want the tickets? Yes. Youre gonna take this kid to Paris? Hey I get a free trip to Paris I go in the Big Brothers Hall-of-Fame I mail my own postcards. You know Im paying for these tickets. Its alright I got lunch. Oh you should have gone to the Costanzas for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella? Not really. Oh its a orgiastic feast for the senses. The want and the festival the sites sounds and colors an mmmummumm mumm Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel? This is it. So how much are we gonna make? Take it easy Ive been through a million of these negotiations. Wha two thousand? Three thousand? Thats giving it away. This is a one of a kind item. More? More than three thousand? Just watch me do my thing. Say Dad (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isnt that one of yours? Look at this. Look at how this idiot packed it. He didnt tape it he just flipped the flaps. (Kramer Morty and Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats which are scattered all over the place.) Kramer you missed a couple. Bon-jour welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight. (turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isnt that your charter group? Honesty hard-work these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night. Hey! I got news for you four eyes theres no way youre staying with us in Paris. You burned them? Those clothes are not yours to burn. Who are you anyways? Im the father. He said his father was dead. He said I was dead? Thats right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five dollars out of me. Thats what my life is worth to him? Twenty-five dollars. Hey Frank! Oh I just want to you know Im retracting our dinner invitation. Well you dont have to retract it because we never went. Im retracting that it was ever offered. I retract your retraction. Oh you trying to unload some of that junk of yours? Would you excuse me please were conducting business here. You can keep your raincoats. Im not interested. I thought we had a deal? Thats another one of my shirts!! Im not buying anymore clothes from anyone off the street. Whos off the street? Im in the raincoat business for thirty-five years. Ya how do I know there arent moths like his stuff? My clothes dont have moths! Because of his moths youre not buying my raincoats? Thats right. (laughing) Im all ticklish. (a moth flies out of his shirt; they all look at it) Flight-433 now boarding for Miami Gate 18a. Flight-433 now boarding. Ok lets go. (to Aaron) It was so nice of you to come to the airport to see us off. Are you sure you cant stay a little longer? NO. Ah good-bye. Good-bye Take care Alright Jer. Nice to see.. Buh bye Elaine Buh bye. Buh bye. (looking at Jerry while being overly hugged by Aaron) Well call you when we get home. Thank you. I think she meant me but.

(turning toward her) No I couldve called the travel agency got them on another flight to Paris I coulda got them out. You tried Aaron it was too expensive. (holds his arm up) This watch this watch couldve paid for their whole trip. (holds his other hand up) This ring this ring is one more dinner I couldve taken them out to. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other like hes crazy) Water they need some water (turns around and runs to the Flight Agent) Why? (to the Flight Agent) Theyll get dehydrated on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some water. Please! Please! Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home? Im afraid Rachels not going to be able to see you tonight or any other night for that matter. Why what did I do? (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) You know very well. I heard about your behavior at the movies the other night it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself I for one will not allow my daughter to be involved with someone of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately my postman happened to have witnessed the entire incident. A heavy set fellow I believe he lives in your building. (Jerry turns to almost do a Newman) Now if you dont mind. (starts to close the door) Rachel! (closing the door on Jerry) Good night! Rachel! So my parents get home they open the door my father flicks the light on the whole place is cleaned out everything. Aahh (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen? The broken window Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in. Oohh boy. They could use a vacation. Yea theyre taking one the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them. (sighs) So how about that Aaron? Whew You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked? No I hadnt noticed. (at the counter) Pair of bear claws please. (hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman. (moving away from the counter getting closer to the door) Hello Jerry. Say I happened to catch you coming out of Schindlers List the other night. Ohh were you there? Yes I was. (looking scared) I-its a its a...powerful film. Yes shocking brutality dont you think? (couple quick breaths) Shocking. Yes well that was nothing. (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry! Where the hell is your father?! This is the best thing we ever did.

Just great. Really great! Oh hey - did you hear about Bob Rosen? Nope. He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president. Knopp? Really? Boy. That means theres an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman uh hired anyone? No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house. Really!? Maybe itll be you! Oh...well... You really deserve it. I mean you have experience seniority...Lippman really respects your opinion... Well! Well it could be you. No... No really. Really? You think so? Sure. Boy wouldnt that be exciting! I mean stranger things have happened... Wow! Me! A senior editor! (deadly serious) Id like that. Well you shouldnt get your hopes up Toby. Well its a possibility like you said! Stranger things have happened! Thank you Elaine. Thank you. (Exits.) Hey Ronnie. Hey. (To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin on tonight? Yeah. You? Yeah. You know Leonard Christians here? Yeah I know. Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger? (looking at his nostrils) I dont...think so. Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger? I dont...I dunno. Is it possible for nostrils to expand? Oh is this a bit? Hey I dont do bits. Im a prop comic. Dammit I cant find my water gun. I cant go on without my water gun. Hey Jerry. (turns to greet Kramer) Hey. Well heres Toby (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry. This is so exciting! Look I have goosebumps! (To Jerry) Touch! Touch them! (Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.) Ive never been to a comedy club before! Really! You know a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now too. You are so funny! Oh youll have a good time I swear. Oh! He swears like he thinks I dont believe him. I believe you. I believe you! Oh hes so funny! (laughs) What about me? What about you? (laughs) Im only kidding. Youre funny too. I love to laugh. Good good. So you up next? Yeah why dont you guys get a table so youll have good seats? Oh yeah we dont want some jerk sitting in front of us itll be like Hey big head can you move out of the way? I didnt pay a cover charge to stare at your bald spot. (laughs) Alright so you have a good show huh buddy? Yeah. Oh have a great show. Hey well make sure its a great show! O.k. good Ill see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramers jacket.) Oh hes so great! This is so great! Im so excited! Men definitely hit the remote button more than women... Oh really! Really! That is so true! Yes yeah...see men dont care whats on TV men only care what else is on TV. Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! (Other audience members give her puzzled looks.) See...women really want to see what the show is before they change the channel... Oh that is so true yes! ...thats why men hunt and women nest. BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! (Tobys obnoxious behavior causes Jerry to completely lose his place and mess up his act.) Yea ya so...anyway what was I talking about. Hey. Hey whats the deal? What was goin on there? I invite you down here I have an important show and she heckles me?! Look she didnt mean anything. Well what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?! Shes just being enthusiastic thats all! Hey! What is wrong with you?! Me? Nothings wrong with me. Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didnt stop blathering throughout the whole set! Oh come on! I thought youre a pro! Thats part of the show. No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies! Well thats the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it in this business if you cant take it? Oh I can take it. Lets go. (Ronnie walks by Jerry.) Hey man. Good set. Bozo? No. B-O-Z-O? Sorry I... Youve never heard of Bozo the Clown? No! How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is? I dont know I just dont. How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is? Hey man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig its not my life. I dont know who Bozo is what - is he a clown? Is he a clown? What are you kidding me!? Well what is he? Yes hes a clown! Alright so whats the big deal! Theres millions of clowns! Alright just forget it. Me forget it? You should forget it! Youre livin in the past man! Youre hung up on some clown from the sixties man! Alright very good very good...go fold your little balloon animals Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown huh? Excuse me...you must be George! Im Robins mother. Oh you seem like such a lovely young man! Well I do what I can. (Robin comes over.) Hi Mom hows everything? Oh this is just a wonderful party! The burgers should be ready in a minute. Ah great great. (sniffs) Whats that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way! It was an inferno in there! An inferno! (Eric Robins mother and all the kids rush at George.) There he is! Thats him! (Tries to clobber George with his big shoe.) Thats the coward that left us to die! I...was trying to lead the way. We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety. But you yelled get out of my way! Because! Because as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards? But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out you left everyone behind! Seemingly. Seemingly to the untrained eye I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire you stay close to the ground am I right? And when I ran out that door I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions? How do you live with yourself? Its not easy. So she doesnt want to see me anymore. Did you knock her over too or just the kids? No her too. And her mother. Really? Her mother. Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm too I dont know. You probably couldnt see because of the smoke. Yeah. But it was somebodys arm. Hmm. So you feel women and children first in this day and age is somewhat of an antiquated notion. To some degree. So basically its every man woman child and invalid for themselves. In a manner of speaking. Yeah well its honest. Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals. Well perhaps when shes released from the burn center shell see things differently. Perhaps. So what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers? Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe. By the way did you see this? (Hands George a magazine) Whats that? Its the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled I betcha its because of the article. Wow he really does a number on you. (reads) Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling. I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer. You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her. Yeah right. You know like all the comedians always say How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you? Yeah thatd be something. Im not kidding you should do it. But wouldnt that be the ultimate comedians revenge? Ive always had a fantasy about doing that. Well go ahead! Do it! Why cant I? No reason! You know what? I think Im gonna do that! She came down to where I work Ill go down to where she works! This is unprecedented! Theres no precedent baby! What...are you using my babies now? Hey nice shoes. What you wear sandals to work? Its always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. Thats real conducive to the work atmosphere. Im sure your co-workers really appreciate it. Hey lets go eat in Tobys office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions! You know I have work to do here! Im very busy! Oh is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting? Well how would you like it if I called security? Security? Well I dont know how youre gonna make it in this business if you cant take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo! No (gets up out of her chair) thats it. (Kramer arrives; to Kramer) Get out of the way. Hey whats going on? Boo! Whats happenin here? Hiss! (going after Toby) Toby! Toby! (voice; screaming) My pinky toe! (voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh Oh! What did you go up there to heckle her for? Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.) Oh YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine alright. Well I didnt want her to have an accident. What accident? Well after he heckled Toby she got so upset she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe. Thats unbelievable! Yeah! Then after the ambulance left I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box filled it with ice and took off for the hospital. Wha.. you ran? No I jumped on the bus. I told the driver I got a toe here buddy - step on it. Holy cow! Yeah yeah then all of a sudden this guy pulls out a gun. Well I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says Where do you think youre going Cracker Jack? I said Well I got a little prize for ya buddy -  (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold! How could you do that?! Then everybody is screamin because the driver hes passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So I grab him by the collar I take him out of the seat I get behind the wheel and now Im drivin the bus. Youre Batman. Yeah. Yeah I am Batman. Then the mugger he comes to and he starts chokin me! So Im fightin him off with one hand and I kept drivin the bus with the other yknow? Then I managed to open up the door and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot you know - at the next stop. You kept makin all the stops? Well people kept ringin the bell! Well wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe? Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line. You did all this...for a pinky toe? Well its a valuable appendage. So Kramer found the toe and they re-attached it. Really. Yea poor kid. What an ordeal. And you know how extremely sensitive she is? I know. Shes gonna need our full support. Yeah right. Look whos here! Toby! (Toby enters on crutches.) Toby what can I do? Can I get you something? Oh no no thank you. Toby please let us help. Were family. Oh well I could use some coffee. She got the promotion? Yep. Why? Ill tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe thats why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her he didnt want to hurt her feelings. Too bad. Sure the pinky toe is cute! But I mean what is it? Its useless! It does nothing. Its got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for? Because Elaine thats the one that goes wee-wee-wee all the home. Why dont you just shut the f- Hey Elaine did you hear the good news? Toby got promoted! Yes I heard Kramer - I work there remember?? Yeah and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible. Oh wonderful! You know throughout this whole thing she always kept a smile on her face. Oh of course! Shes deranged. I went down to the magazine I pleaded with him to come and see me again finally he agreed to come down tonight and hes going to write another article. I heard you went down to somebodys office and heckled them? Damn right! Weve been lapdogs long enough! How could you do that? I mean everybodys talking about it. Yeah well its about time one of us drew a line in the sand. Jerry youre like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of us. I cant wait till the next time someone heckles me. Yeah well it wont be long. Ladies and gentlemen please welcome Jerry Seinfeld! Gotta go. (heads out on stage) Robin? Robin! George what is it? Im working. Robin listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think Ive changed. What are you talking about? O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.) I mean Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need the clown in his title as clown? Bozo the clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? Theres no other Bozo... ...youll see things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance. L-listen Listen...I gotta think about this. (walks away.) Alright but Im serious about this. Alright hand it over man! ...thats why men hunt and women nest. Hes got a gun! Hes got a gun! Get out of the way! (Tries to flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage perplexed.) George! This is Ronnie Kaye! The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh hi...I didnt recognize you what...did you get a haircut? Nostrils. George - could I have a word?]
83,5,21,[All right get off at the next exit. Kramer Ive driven to east Hampton many times I know the exit. Its a great house pool sun deck? Yeah Ill be there. (To Elaine) You sure were makin the right move? We gotta see the new baby anyway at least well get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it. Didnt they just have a baby? That was two years ago remember? Jeh-Ree you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee! Is it possible theyre just having babies to get people to visit them? Hey Jerry you ever wear silk underwear? No. Put that on the top of your list. No not for me. A little too delightful. Well George and Jane should be almost there by now. Oh isnt that weird that George and Jane havent had sex yet but theyre spending a weekend together? I know George is pretty pleased about it. Its like she signed a letter of intent. Whens Rachel comin out? Shes makin the three oclock train. Her father is so religious Im just amazed that hes letting you see her again after that Schindlers List make-out session. I bought him some kishka. Whats that? Its kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case theyre captured behind enemy lines they eat it and it kills them. I never tasted a cough medicine I didnt love. Me too. I love cough medicine. You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) Its amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not shed scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow I could touch it all I want. Whats your favorite? Potussan. Ever try it with club soda? No. Oh very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. Ill be the same me tomorrow but suddenly the no trespassing sign will be gone. Are we almost there? Yeah about ten fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand. What for? My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. Shes nuts for Hampton tomatoes. Can you buy em later? I really wanna get some... sun. Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back. Who are you Mrs. Robinson? Come on Ill rub some on yours. No thats no sweetning the deal. No. (To Jane) You know when I was a kid I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool. (No feeling in her voice) You mustve been excited. Yeah. Hey you know I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride? I dont think so. Kay. Ill uh Ill see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes? No thanks. No. (George leaves for the tomatoes) Im gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach Elaine enters with a shady hat on) And then theres Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry) Look at my face look at it. You see any lines? No lines. You know why? One word: shade. So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event? I dont know. Theyre takin a nap or something. Im gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine you wanna come? (Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends. (Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting. What? Janes topless. (They all look) Yo yo ma. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door) Come on you guys. You can come and see the bay-bee! Oh in a minute Carol. Were gonna be right there. This is weird wild stuff. George hasnt even seen her yet. Why do you think were getting the sneak preview? Maybe shes trying to create a buzz. What? You know get some good word of mouth goin. Oh here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters) Im thirsty. Anyone want a drink? No thanks. Im good. Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right shows over. Im goin to the beach. Adam (the babys name) Jerry and Elaine are here. Oh hes a cute little shnugly baby. Isnt he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby only to be frightened and turn away) Ugghh. Is she gorgeous? (Elaine and Jerry looking away) Oh gorgeous yes. So very gorgeous. Michael shut the door! Youre letting bugs in. Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen? Uh I couldnt look. It was like the Pekinese. Boy a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And you know the thing is theyre never gonna know no ones ever gonna tell them. Oh you have to lie. Its a must lie situation. Yes its a must lie situation. You know I dont think we should tell George we saw Jane topless. No I dont think so. In fact remind me to tell Kramer too. Oooh lobsters. Oh this ointment should do it. How are you feeling Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) Elaine! (Elaine enters) This is our pediatrician Ben Feffa. Hi. Look at him Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you how gorgeous? (Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous. Elaine you have children? Me? Oh no but Id love to have a baby I mean I cant wait to have a baby. Im just dyin to have a baby. A beautiful woman like you should. Youre quite breathtaking. Breathtaking? Im breathtaking? And hes very particular. Ben youre staying tonight right? Uh Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and quickly looks away from the baby) Ah Im gonna go pick up Rachel at the station. Yeah see ya. Okay. (He leaves) Oh just look at him! Yeah he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his comment) Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the wrong way. Oh I like that. Its like going back in time. (George comes outside) Hey Rachel! (Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. Im gonna go in there to change. What kind of a greeting was that? Shes got greeting problems. Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know you can eat em like apples. You know its funny the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit. Well the tomatos an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce but you cant find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster) Hey hey hey! Look at what I got! Hey! Wow the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside) You got lobster for everybody? Yeah and theyre fresh! Right out of the ocean. This is fantastic. Man what a weekend. Swimming lobster for dinner... I know its great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that damn expression behind George) You saw who what? Yeah I saw Jane topless. Well we all saw her. (Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right. You saw Jane topless? Well when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless. Oh you mean face down on her chest. No. Face up on her back? Yeah. Well whyd she do that? I guess she was hot. You mean she just laid there topless? No no she got up she walked around... Walked around? And you looked? Of course. Shes got a great body buddy. All right Im gonna go upstairs Ill be right back. I cant believe that you saw her before me. Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again) Well how good a look did you get? Well whatd you mean? Well if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist... Theyd pick her up in about ten minutes. Great great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked. (looking of into the distance) I guess thats true... Stop it stop it! Its not fair. Its not fair. I dont like this situation Jerry. I dont like it one bit. What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked? Yes yes! The punishment should fit the crime. You can see me naked. I can offer you that. Its like Im Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first. Nobody ever called me breathtaking before. Ive never been called breathtaking either. I mean if he thinks that that babys breathtaking then whos not breathtaking? Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room. Yeah right thats a possibility. I have to find out. How are you gonna do that? I can be very clever. Im gonna take a swim. Oh me too. Ill meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh dont go in Rachels getting undressed. Oh okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in) Hey! Oh sorry. Dont you knock? Im sorry uh its not like Im gonna see something Ive never seen before. You might have. I didnt. You wont. Whatd you want anyway George? Yes George. Im kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want? No I was just wondering... if you guys uh had any gum. Oh! So you were swimming in the pool and you wanted some gum. Yes because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up. We dont have any gum. Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits) Strange man. Waitll you get to know him. So where is this baby anyway? Oh check it out. I guarantee youve never seen anything quite so objectionable. Its down the hall third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit) (She screams) Oh my God! Im sorry I thought this was the babys room. Im really sorry. (She exits) (realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool! Did she do it on purpose? It was my fault I told her the wrong door. I was supposed to see her. She wasnt supposed to see me. So what? Well ordinarily I wouldnt mind. But... But... Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold... Oh... You mean... shrinkage. Yes. Significant shrinkage. So you feel you were short changed. Yes! I mean if she thinks thats me shes under a complete misapprehension. That was not me Jerry. That was not me. Well so whats the difference? What if she discusses it with Jane? Oh shes not gonna tell Jane. How do you know? Women arent like us. Theyre worse! Theyre much worse than us they talk about everything! Couldnt you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor? No Im not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides I think women know about shrinkage. How do women know about shrinkage? Isnt it common knowledge? (Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters) Do women know about shrinkage? What do you mean like laundry? No. Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards... It shrinks? Like a frightened turtle! Why does it shrink? It just does. I dont know how you guys walk around with those things. Thanks for the lobster Kramer. Rachel arent you gonna have any? Oh no I cant. Im kosher we dont eat shellfish. You mean youve never tasted lobster? No. Wow. Youre so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die youre gonna get some special attention. Oh the babys crying. Ill go get him. He can sit with us. No! No you dont wanna do that. Youll be uncomfortable. Yeah finish eating. The babys not gonna have any fun over here. Were-Were not fun for a baby. Yeah the lobsterll scare him. Im gonna get him. See look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger and now it shrunk. You see thats what water does. It shrinks things. Really? Tell us more Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Janes ear which prompts Jane to laugh) Whatre you doing? Whatre you telling secrets? Whatre you laughing at? Its nothing George. You know its very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me? What is it with you? (To George) Easy big fella. So Kramer whered you get all these lobster at the Fleeshers Market? No I got em in the ocean. The ocean? Whatd you mean? Well I found this rope and I kept tugging on it and all these lobsters came up. Those are commercial lobster traps. You cant take those lobsters from there. Thats against the law. Take it easy. Theres plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone. My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at four and came home every night stinking of brine! He sent me through law school with the lobsters he caught! (Kramer stands up from table) (Entering with baby) Here he is. Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby) Some night huh? Yeah I wish I had my telescope. Some dinner huh? Nothing like fresh caught lobster. Some house huh? It was built by Mark Fargman. He build a lot of these homes here. Some ugly baby huh? What did you say? (improvising) I said uh some snuggly baby. He is something. Well to tell you the truth Dr. Feffa I  I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby I mean because you also used it referring to me. Well you know Elaine sometimes you say things just to be nice. (Elaine relieved then confused not knowing if he was being nice to her or to the baby) You told her? Yeah whats the big deal? You dont understand. This organ its very... schizophrenic. Jerry what the difference? You know youre the ones obsessed with this stuff not us. Im sure it wouldnt matter to Jane. Youre going back to New York now? Yeah I have some things to do. Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel thats what I think. So what if I did? And she didnt say something to you about a certain something? I dont know what youre talking about. *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be when in fact it is is all that it *should* be and *more*! (patronizing George) Im sure it is. Look you dont understand. There was shrinkage. You looking for this? (Holding up lobster) Oh Kramer! You startled me. Well I thought you might wind up around here. Yeah well I couldnt stop thinking about how everyone was enjoying the lobster so much an well I thought I little taste wouldnt hurt huh? No Im afraid I couldnt do that. Why not? Well that wouldnt be kosher. Cmon Kramer. I really want to try it. Nah Im sorry honey. Not on my watch. Come on Kramer. Heyahhh! I just heard a car drive out. What was that? Oh thats just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked) George thanks so much for making breakfast. George these are the best scrambled eggs Ive ever tasted. Ya I didnt know you could cook. Well Im just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host. Yes George the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (hearing this Elaine looks at him extremely annoyed) Good morning. Hey hey. Morning Kramer I just want to thank you again for last night you really saved me. What happened? Well I almost tried the lobster but Kramer stopped me. Well I knew youd regret it for the rest of your life. Youre right I would have. (Referring to George) Hey look at this guy. A little breakfast. Yeah. (To Rachel) And uh you eat eggs right? Yes I do. Thank you. Geez these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this? Umm... This is so good. Ah enjoying them? Mm-hmm. Uh good. You know you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib) Theres lobster in these eggs? Not that much. You know they tend to shrink in the water. Well I guess I gotta go too. Well this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door Michael answers) Excuse me? Im sorry to bother you but were trying to track down a lobster poacher that uh cleaned out on of the traps. Wonder whats goin on. Ah I guess I should go up and apologize. There he is officer. (Michael points to Kramer Kramer waves to policeman) Ahh! Dont you ever knock? I dont know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol. Hey if you saw me naked I wouldnt want to ride back in the same car with you either. I still cant believe Michael finked on Kramer. How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine? They got some sort of program. Hey theres a tomato stand lets stop I can get some more. Hey isnt that Michaels car? Theres Rachel. Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)]
84,5,22,[To your promotion. Oh thank you! (They drink) Mmm Oh thank you Mr Lippman I cant tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean of course I deserve it. Well youre really on your way now. You really oughtta do something about that cold. You got a raise? I dont fool around (banging on the table) baby! I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble. They were but theyre being absorbed by Matsushimi that big Japanese conglomerate. Oh when did that happen? Theyre signing the papers next week. Does this mean theyre gonna be publishing Kramers coffee table book? Yeah theyll definitely do it now. Boy youre on quite a streak. Job promotion plus youre back with Jake Jarmal. Yeah its gettin serious were talking about moving in together. Boy you really got it all Im sure Helen Girlie Brown would be very proud of you. Speaking of having it all ... Where were you? I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks) Oh the beach. Its not working Jerry. Its just not working. (sits down next to Elaine) What is it that isnt working? Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh maybe not academically speaking (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someones uncomfortable at a party. (pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there? It became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision Ive ever made in my entire life has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have in every of aspect of life be it something to wear something to eat ... Its all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere. Yeah. No no no wait a minute I always have tuna on toast. Nothings ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad on rye un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs) Well theres no telling what can happen from this. You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna salmon is the opposite of tuna cuz salmon swim against the current (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it) (annoyed) Good for the tuna. Ah George you know that woman just looked at you. So what? What am I supposed to do? Go talk to her. Elaine bald men with no jobs and no money who live with their parents dont approach strange women. Well heres your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women chicken salad and going right up to them. Yeah I should do the opposite I should. If every instinct you have is wrong then the opposite would have to be right. Yes I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing and regret it for the rest of the day so now I will do the opposite and I will do something! Excuse me uh I couldnt help but notice that you were looking in my direction. Oh yes I was you just ordered the same exact lunch as me. My name is George. Im unemployed and I live with my parents. Im Victoria. Hi. (on the phone) Are you kidding? They cant cancel that show on me now its too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright alright ... okay bye. (hangs up the phone) Hey. Buddy its all happening! Whats happening? The coffee table book. Its a go-oo! Oh yeah I heard all about it. You know what this means? Im starting the book tour. First stop : Regis and Kathy Lee. Youre going on Regis and Kathy Lee? Oh you better believe it! Ill loan you my puffy shirt. No no no. Whatre you gonna talk about? Well coffee tables. Hello? What? Yeah sure Ill do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another same weekend same money. You know who you are? Even Steven Are you growing a beard? Why shave every day? It just grows right back. I guess ... Im afraid Im just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you this probably isnt gonna work. Hey watch he just cut you off! Did you see that?! Take it easy. Take it easy. Its not the end of the world. What are we gonna do? Should we just move? That wont be necessary. Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! Were trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again were gonna take it outside and Im gonna show you what its like! You understand me? Now shut your mouths or Ill shut em for ya and if you think Im kidding just try me. Try me. Because I would love it! Are you sure you dont wanna come up I mean its only nine thirty. I dont think we should. We really dont know each other very well. Who are you George Costanza? Im the opposite of every guy youve ever met. Excuse me is your name Elaine? Yes. Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here? Yeah. Well Im afraid hes been in an accident. (gasp) An accident? What happened? Well-he got side-swiped by a cab but hes alright. Hes in St.Vincent Hospital room 907. Oh. Ok. Thank you. Could I have a box of Jujyfruits? (handing the Jujyfruits to Elaine) There you go. So then you know the light was clearly green I started walking he skidded and he went right into my hip. (With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh that is so terrible. That is so terrible Jake. I mean how can people be so stupid? Just sickening. You want one? No thanks. So when do you think youre gonna get outta here? Where did you get those? At the movies. Didnt the theater manager give you the message before you went in? Yeah he did. Then when did you get those? Right after ... that ... So you heard that I was in a car accident and then decided to stop off for some Jujyfruit? Well... the counter...was right there and... I would think under the circumstances it would have sent you running out the building. Apparently it didnt have any effect on you. No no it does! (angry) If you got into a car accident I can guarantee you I wouldnt stop for Jujyfruit! But...Jake... I would like to be alone now please. But Jake I didnt... Goodnight! (shocked) Broke even. Can I bring out our next guest now? Please please. Young guy hes got a new book coming out and its about and this is the best part - I love this. Its a coffee table book about coffee tables! (holds the book up for the audience) Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever! I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage? I did. I mean he looks like a fun guy doesnt he? I love his hair. Yeah oh I do too. This guy could be a little bonkos. Really. Anyway if you will would you please welcome: Kramer! (shaking Kramers hand) Hello Kramer is here. I dont know maybe its the hair or something! Ah well yes Kramer. So a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where did you come up with this idea? Yeah well ah Ill tell you uh Regis... actually this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time. You know when Im skiing Kramer Im trying not to kill myself youre writing books! Yeah well now you kids dont go out and try that. You stay in school! Have you always had an interest in coffee tables because really I-I love coffee tables and I-I thought I was the only one. You see the beauty of my book is if you dont have a coffee table it turns into a coffee table. Is that fabulous? Look at this! Is that fabulous? Fabulous! I want one of these. Did I tell you this guy was bonkos? This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities coffee tables. Thats true. Thats right. Yeah? Well Im not in there. Wheres mine? Oh its on file right here. (points to his head) Im tellin ya this guys bonkos! He really is! But hes adorable. Ya he is hes a nice looking guy. Its all over my dress. Well be right back in a moment. So its all over? Yeah it got pretty nasty. And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit? Its not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab. Why didnt you eat it in the cab? Because I got popcorn too and I ate that first. Whats all this? Played cards last night. Oh yeah? Howd you do? Broke even. You always break even. Yeah I know; like yesterday I lost a job and then I got another one and then I missed a TV show and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out! Do you have twenty bucks? What for? Just gimme twenty bucks. (shocked) What the hell was that? Lets see if you get the twenty bucks back. You know you couldve thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back. You know things were going so good for me you know I got the job promotion we were talking about moving in together - Well maybe next time someones in a car accident you wont stop off for candy first. Hey I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down black was white good was - Bad. Day was - Night. Yes! So you just did the opposite of everything? Yes. And listen to this listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and hes gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child and its all happening because Im completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine Jerry this is my religion. So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ. Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) lets go. Elaine ... look! A twenty! (not wanting to believe it) Oh my God. Hey boss. Kramer. Come in. Howre you doin there big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian) Uh Ya Have a seat. Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold? Woah thats quite a honk! Ya thank you. Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids. The reason I asked you in here is I-I caught your appearance on uh Regis and Kathy Lee the other day and - Ya that was pretty good huh? An-Anyway the thinking here is that it would be best i-if you uh didnt do any more of these shows. Because of the coffee thing? Kramer Im sorry. What about Sonia Live? Now youre not cancelling Sonia Live? Its out - Shes a doctor I got a thing for her. Kra-Kramer I - Why dont you tell me about some of your previous work experience? Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman. Go on. Ah Alright before that I was in real estate. I quit because the boss wouldnt let me use his private bathroom. That was it. Do you talk to everybody like this? Of course. My niece told me you were different. I am different yeah. I gotta tell ya you are the complete opposite of every applicant weve seen. (gets out of his chair) Ah Mr. Steinbrenner sir. Theres someone here Id like you to meet. (George gets up and goes over) This is Mr. Costanza. Hes one of the applicants. Nice to meet you. Well I wish I could say the same but I must say with all due respect I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself and the city of New York a good deal of distress as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock all for the glorification of your massive ego! Hire this man! Tina Robbins is here to see you. Whos that? Ah its my ex-roommate she moved out four years ago I-Ive been sub-letting my apartment from her. Alright see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey. Please. Hi Tina. Hi Elaine. So I havent seen you in a while. Elaine we have a problem. Well what is it? Youre getting kicked out. Kicked out?! Why?! Well theres been a number of complaints. Yeah? Like what? Well like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief. Ah I didnt know who he was! Thats why theres a buzzer. What else? Well apparently the week after that you buzzed up some Jehovas Witnesses and they couldnt get them out of the building. What else have you got? Well lets see. (Takes out a list from her bag) Ill tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If youre going out with someone your size right there you double your wardrobe. I suppose... Oh come on thats a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit Im sure thats one of the big selling points. (sighs) Jerry ... Yes? Ive been doing a lot of thinking. Uh huh? Well I dont think we should see each other any more. Oh thats okay. (confused) What? Nah thats fine. No problem. Ill meet somebody else. You will? Sure. See things always even out for me. Huh? Its fine. Anyway its been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck! Yeah you too. (leaving; singing) Shell be coming around the mountain... The New York Yankees?! The New York Yankees! Ruth Gehrig DiMaggio Mantle ... Costanza? Im the assistant to the travelling secretary. Im going on the road trips with em! Ill be on the plane... Im working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream Im busting Jerry Im busting! I cant believe it. Ya! Ya? (on buzzer) Its me. (buzzes Elaine up) Come on up. And Im moving out of my parents house Im taking that apartment on 86th street remember the one we saw? Thats a great place! Im back in business baby! George I wouldnt get too excited about this stuff you know things have a way of evening out. Hey! (to Elaine who doesnt look too cheerful) Hi Elaine. Hi. Howre things going? Howre things going? You wanna know how things are going? Ill tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment! Why? Why are they doing that? I dont know! They have a list of grievances. The jewel thief? Yeah the jewel thief. What else? I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month. Well you could move in with my parents. (chuckles) Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes Georges mouth between her fingers) Instinct. Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead) Elaine dont get too down. Everythingll even out see I have two friends you were up (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now hes up (switches the positioning of his hands) youre down. You see how it all evens out for me? Mr. Lippman the people from Matsushimi are here. Oh ya alright... tell them Ill be right there. (tosses his handkerchief on Elaines desk so he can tie his shoe) Oh man well this is it Elaine. You know without this merger wed be out on the street. Boy they sure saved us. (noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Its on my desk. (noticing Mr. Lippman in the hallway) Ah Lippman son. (Lippman smiles and is forced to enter his office) Lippman son. (speaks some Japanese) Mr Lippman it is with great pride that we undertake this partnership with your company. I ... Im sorry I cant shake your hand right now. Its germs. Is that the end of it? Yeah its the last one. Alright. I cant believe youre moving out. (Grabs Kramer) Kramer is this true? Is it really happening? Its ... its like a dream. Oh its true. Alright lets go. Dont get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. (Slaps Georges forehead) Im not gonna be nice. Thats how I got the job. Jerry did you hear this? He knows what hes doing. I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me and I love you both very very much. Opposite. I mustve had at least eight in my mouth. I couldnt talk. I couldnt talk! Whyd you have to eat so many? Because theyre Jujyfruit. I like them. I didnt know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing. Not to mention the end of Kramers coffee table book. Yeah you knew he had a cold. Howd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA! Do you know whats going on here? Cant you see whats happened? Ive become George. Dont say that. Its true. Im George! Im George! Greetings people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Lets play two! (Sits down says to waitress :) Oh Ill have the chicken salad on rye my usual you know what I get darlin. (Turns to the Gang) So lets see I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) hes the first base man. Uh huh. We talked about his new batting stance you know Im not crazy about it but I said  Donny go with it till it stops workin. Donny baseball. Hes a helluva guy. Wait wait wait thats too much. Mine was more than yours. Ah ... lets call it even.]
85,6,1,[O.K. Danny take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! Youre opening up your shoulder. Really? No not really. Im just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes really! Alright alright. What are all sweatin for? Its hot in this uniform. Hot? (Feels Tartabulls material.) What is this? What is what? This uniform whats it made from? I dont know cotton? No. This is not cotton. Here lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester! So? I cant believe youre not playing in cotton. Well this is what they give us. You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric? You really think cottons better? Of course! Alright maybe Ill say something to Buck. Yeah good idea. Catch ya later. (Leaves.) Hey dont embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.) Hot dogs here! Yankee franks! Oh you want one? Yeah. Ill get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.) Thats alright I got it. Jerry! Elaine stop it. Hey just because Im not working doesnt mean I havent got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two! Im sorry. Your attention please...the New York Yankees would like to welcome Miss Connecticut Miss Rhode Island and Miss North Dakota all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this weekend in Atlantic City. (The three contestants make their way to their seats right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.) Now theres a career path you may have overlooked. Ooh I gotta check my machine. Im waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis. Oh she worked at Doubleday...? Yeah she was an editor. Right just like you. Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.) Hey! Down in front! (Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.) Hot dog? No thanks. Im watching my weight. Ah. Im watching my height. My doctor doesnt want me to get any taller. So youre Miss uh... Rhode Island. I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.) Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her? Tonight. I have to call her shes staying in a hotel. Youre incredible. And get this - Im working in Atlantic City this weekend and shes going to be down there for the pageant. What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America Jerry! The only bad thing is we have to go out with a chaperone. Chaperone? What are you kidding? No its part of the contest rules. What does the chaperone do? I dont know she just sits there. Can she talk? Im not sure if shes allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.) Youre calling her? Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes room 417 please? Karen Hanson? Hey did you know that the Yankees dont wear cotton jerseys? Of course theyre polyester. Well what is that? Thats a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton. Why do they wear polyester? I dont know. Thats all gonna change. Youre going to do something about it? Why shouldnt I? No reason... Of course Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace. Yes! Grace! Not many people have grace. Well you know grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie - You cant have a little grace. You either have grace or you...dont. O.K. fine I have...no grace. And you cant acquire grace. Well I have no intention of getting grace. Grace isnt something you can pick up at the market. Alright alright look - I dont have grace I dont want grace...I dont even say grace O.K.? Thank you for coming in. Yeah yeah right. Well make our choice in a few days and well let you know. I have no chance do I? No. (They shake hands.) Justin Pitt to see you. Justin Pitt? He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassiss. Mrs. Onassiss? Thats hard to pronounce. Excuse me? Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.) Mrs. Landis theres something wrong with this copying machine its all coming out slanted. Now I dont know if this is your department or not. Justin Pitt this is Elaine Benes. (Elaine turns around. With sunglasses and a scarf on her head she bears a close resemblance to Jackie O.) Charmed. I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis... Hello Karen? Its Jerry Seinfeld. Oh thats very sweet of you. You know you better be careful you dont want to get too congenial. Theyll slap that Miss Congeniality on you and youll congene yourself right out of the contest. So what time do you want to get together later? What? So what we dont need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone cant make it. (To Karen) Oh youre not gonna get disqualified! So were not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey what are you doing tonight? Nothin. Im going out with one of the Miss America contestants you wanna go? What state? Rhode Island. Theyre never in contention. How do you know? Because Ive seen every Miss America pageant since I was six. Look do you want to go or not? Ill buy you dinner. Giddy-up! I think I got someone! The resemblance is uncanny. (Elaine sipping soda through a straw looks up with a sour expression on her face.) Even the brown eyes. Well a lot of people have brown eyes. No theres something else. An indefinable quality. Grace? Grace yes. You think Ihave grace? Some grace yes. Just some? Well you dont want too much grace or you wont be able to stand. Oh Mr. Pitt. Elaine I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. Now Ill pay you the same as Pendant but I would need you to start right away. Hey Buck. Talk to you for a second? Sure George. Hows everything going? Everything O.K.? Well all of a sudden theres a problem with Tartabulls swing... Listen Buck I uh...obviously I dont need to talk to you about the importance of player morale but uh...Ive been talking to some of the guys and some of them - I dont want to mention any names - but some of them...theyre not too happy with the polyester uniforms. How so? Well they get very hot in the polyester. You know its not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton. Cotton huh? Yeah. Cotton breathes you see its much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Dont you think that would be an advantage? Theyre cooler theyre more comfortable...theyre happier - theyre gonna play better. You may have something there George. Oh - Ive got something. Hmm. Cotton uniforms. Congratulations! Yeah! And the best part is I still get to look for work in publishing. Now what is it that you do exactly? I attend to his personal affairs. Like what? Well like tomorrow for example I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks. Really! Socks! Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers. Hey maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.) So what do you think? Does this work? Listen...tonight after we finish eating you make like you got something else to do and just recede into the night if you know what I mean. No way! What? Look if you think Im just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman youre crazy. Im not going to defile her! Thats right because Im going to see it doesnt happen. Look Jerry these girls are Miss America contestants. Its every little girls dream. And Im not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for. But - AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules. But wait a minute... Now if you want to go out and have some good wholesome fun with a nice girl Id be glad to help you out...if youre looking for something more than that youve got the wrong guy buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech but Kramer wont budge an inch.) If you were Miss America what would you do to make the world a better place? As Miss America I would try and bring an end to world hunger. If every person sacrificed one meal a week there would be enough to feed the whole world! Thats a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen - What advice would you give young people? Alright Kramer! This is important stuff! Shes got to be able to answer these questions. Shes not going to have time to think out there with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know poise counts. You really know a lot about this dont you? Oh yeah like last year? Miss Texas? Now she should have won easily but she lost points in the swimsuit competition. Well what could she have done? Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.) What else? Well take you for example. Now youre very attractive but you got a big waist. Hey come on! No no...its O.K. (To Kramer) Go on. Well Id recommend a waist cincher. Really. Oh yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in. Ill be right back. (Leaves the table.) So whats your talent? Magic. Mmm. Im thinking of a number from one to ten. Six. No five. But you were close. Hows your evening? Well Im wearing this red dress - Stop right there. No good? Disaster. Why? Well you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress. That makes sense. (The limo stops at Karens hotel.) Well here we are... Kramer would you consider being my personal consultant for the pageant? Okay. But if Im going to do this we play by my rules or we dont play at all. I am in your hands. (They shake hands.) Well! Oh good night Jerry. (Theyre about to kiss but Kramer stops them by clearing his throat.) Kenneth will take you home. (She gets out leaving Jerry staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.) Hey. Well if it isnt Mr. Blackwell. Oh come on. And that waist cincher that was the topper! Oh youre poo-pooing! Yes I poo-poo. Well let me tell you something. Im taking this kid to the top. To the top Jerry! Were going for the crown and you cant stop her! I dont want to stop her! You cant stop her Jerry! Oh Ive seen em come and go but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.) Yeah so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.) Well did you see it? See what? The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) Wade Boggs: What a fabric! Finally we can breathe. Luis Palonia: Cotton is king. Paul ONeill: I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.  Boy they really do sound comfortable. Hey where ya goin? Im working in Atlantic City. Really! Yeah. Hey youre not working this weekend why dont you come down? Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. Im in. Im down. You know what maybe Elaine wants to go too lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) Shes at Mr. Pitts I think I got the number... So what do you think? No. You dont like them? No I dont like them. Whats wrong? Theyre too tight. Too tight? Theres no elastic you need to pull too much (pulls them up more). I think they look good! Theyre cutting off the circulation. Alright well Ill just take them back. (The phone rings.) Hello? Hi Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there? Its for you. Sorry. Hello? Hey Elaine its me. Jerry? Were going to Atlantic City. Really? When? Today right now! Are you in? One second hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yes. But I was hoping for my new socks today! Well its just one more day. Im sorry. I must have them today. I cant go. Why not? Because I have to return the socks and get different ones. Elaine! I gotta go. (Hangs up.) No. Alright watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn back head up shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture. Yes I see. O.K. Lets try a few more questions alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemys leader what would you do? Kramer are these questions really that important...? Yes theyre important! If you stumble if you hesitate you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if Ive told you once Ive told you a thousand times - poise counts! Its just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE! Hey. Hey. How was the show? Good. How was the roulette? I won fifty bucks! Boy this is great. Too bad Elaines not here. Yeah all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks! Its good but... But what?? Ultimately I dont think theyll stay up. No no! Theyll stay up! For a while yes but not in the long run. But thats why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.) Oh forget about those! (Takes the socks from Elaine and throws them on the floor.) Why do you keep mentioning those? What do you want!? I want a decent sock thats comfortable that will stay on my foot!! What the hell is that? I dont know it sounds like pigeons or something! Well I cant sleep with that noise. Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up? Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) Thisll scare em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well good night Ollie. Good night Stan. What is it? My doves! Theyre dead! I trained those birds for eight years! How am I supposed to do my magic act now? How did this happen? They like it outside so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then I found them dead in a pool of water! Well how did this happen? It must have been an accident. Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered. Well thats it! Shes out of the pageant! What? Why? What happened? Her birds are dead. Birds? Yeah birds. Shes got these trained doves she does this magic act that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldnt stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerrys balcony.) What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh that! We had to leave that outside last night because the water was making the room too cold. You killed them didnt you? No you dont understand - its not what you think! It was an accident! Well dont think youve won because you havent! This kid is a fighter! And if you think Im gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way youre crazy! Kramer you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.) What was that all about? Oh it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Islands doves with a bucket of water last night. Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.) O.K. this is it! How ya feelin? Im a little nervous! Theres nothing to be nervous about. But Ive never sung before in my life! And now lets welcome Karen Ann Hanson Miss Rhode Island! I heard those doves were really incredible. Thats a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.) Its like watching an animal get tortured. Hey hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.) Oh great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.) Thats a shame. Poise. Poise!]

Umph sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless its on the green. The rules are very clear about that. Certainly are. Ya so I penalized him a stroke. He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . All right. Youre in MY face. I still dont see what the big deal is. A rule is a rule. And lets face it. Without rules theres chaos. I like Anna Quindlens column and Safire. Dont you like Safire? Oh Safire. Uh ha Although at times can be rather pedantic.

She just took credit for my salad. Thats not right. No it isnt. I mean Im the one who bought it. Yes you did. You think she should have said something? She could have. Oh I know. Imagine her taking credit for your big salad. You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it. Obviously. Turn on the TV. What? Im puttin it on... . . . the district attorneys office and the police department have not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case youre just joining us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson has been taken to Police headquarters for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus wife Gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at Vancourtlands Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something well just have to wait. Jerry . . . Well it has nothing to do with you. Yeah but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner. Well generally speaking you dont need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldnt worry about that. I like Julie. Shes very personable. Yeah shes very lovely. Thats great George. So did you enjoy your lunch? Yeah A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht? oh . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though . . . Even though what? . . . naw its just you thanked HER and and oh . . . whats the difference? What? What are you trying to say George? Its just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But its no big deal. You want the money for the big salad George? No no What is the problem? There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad. And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it. Well they havent even arrested him yet. Come on lets go out. Ah no  I dont think so. Why not? We dont need a bunch of people staring at us. Who is staring? Oh theyre staring. They know were on a date. Theyre making fun. Come on. Its embarrassing. Hello. No shes not here. Yes I will tell her. No I dont know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta go. Goodbye. . . . That thats a long story. Hello Newman. Hello Jerry I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was. No no I dont. Why? You know Genderson. This is something big. I suppose. What did Kramer say? I dont know. Nothing.? Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME! Oh chocolates . . . Margaret? Hello. You two know each other? You might say that. We used to go out. Well tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret goodbye Jerry. Have fun. Hehe . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman? Just a few times. Why? I liked him. You liked Newman? Look Im a little uncomfortable talking about this okay? No Im sorry. Im just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him. He ended it. . . . HE ended it? YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter? No no of course not. Jerry Jerry they found a tee. What tee? A golf tee. In the dry cleaner. Newman! She went out with Newman! It must be a mistake. No. It isnt and the most distressing part of it is not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why did HE Newman stop seeing her? Perhaps theres more to him than meets the eye. No theres less. Its possible. No it isnt. Ive looked into his eyes. Hes pure evil. Hes an enigma a mystery wrapped in a riddle. Yeah hes a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie. No but thank you. Oh by the way your stationery store guy called and hes got your pencil. Ugh! You are kidding me. No he left the store early made a special trip to the distributor and got it. I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. Well what did you do that for? You ordered it. To please Mr. Pitt. Well you better go down there and tell this guy. Hes very excited. Uh great! Hi Julie. Hi. Hi Julie. Hi how are you Elaine? Im meeting George here. Oh well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. How do you know THAT? Who is it. Its Jerry. Youve come at a bad time now. Could you come back later? Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR! Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the east wing? Okay pudgy lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret? Theres no need to get excited. Cant we discuss this like gentlemen? No we cant. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rats nest. Now what happened? Do you really want to know what happened? Ill tell you what Happened. She wasnt my type. Noit your type? Not really. Well how come? Ah she just didnt do it for me. What what is wrong with her? Well h ha ha- if youre happy with her thats all that matters. You dont think shes attractive? No. I need a really pretty face. But Hey thats me. Okay Newman thanks a lot. Care for some lemonade? No thank you. Drop bye anytime jerry. Hah ha ha Listen to this If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke.  Thats a rule Jerry. But its just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler? Because thats the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine oclock. And if I wasnt well I dont have to tell you what happened. What are you so worried about this for? You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? He did? Oh yeah he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. So it had nothing to do with you. Yeah but maybe I pushed him over the edge. No I dont think so. Poor Pinkus poor little Pinkus. Hey let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margarets good looking? Um shes a natural beauty. Oh no makeup. I like that. Yeah and the curls. You like the curls? Oh I love curls. Yeah me too. All right Ill see you later. Where you going? Gendersons. Youre going to see Genderson? Its weighing on my conscience. You know I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesnt seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. Whats so terrible? Ha. So George I was talking to Elaine before. A ha! Were just friends. Yes well anyway she said something that was kind of intriguing. Oh share. Well when I came over to the table she mentioned something about how she better hurry up and leave or youd make her buy lunch to make up for the one you bought yesterday. Ha ha ha uh Im not following that. Well my question is How could Elaine be under the impression that you bought the big salad when I was the one who handed it to her? Well she probably just assumed. Um did she? . . .uh . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad that it came from me? Thats what Im suggesting. . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH? George all I did was hand someone a bag. Its just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away. Well why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were going to get one someplace else? No no no I didnt know. I Im sorry. I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three hours. I had a big fight with the foreman. Really? A fight with the foreman? Yes. Well again Im just awfully sorry. Yeah? Well then how about going out with me tonight? Okay. I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody walks into a dry cleaners with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. You had how many dates with him? Three? Around three. I dont know. And . . I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. Im not hung up on him. What are you looking at? What? Im not looking. Nothing. Why are you looking at my face? Where am I going to look? Kiss me. . . . I cant. Newman! All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable. Well Im going out with the stationery store guy. Youre going out with the stationery store guy? I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldnt say no. Well well well Im not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didnt ya. Uh uh. You know if it was a regular salad I wouldnt have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD. Hello what? Youre kidding. Im turning it on. Oh my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Gendersons arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike. As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and dont want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer one of Gendersons golfing buddies. 9-1-1 What are you reporting Yeah this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. Im taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off. Okay sir and whats your name? My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit! I thought we would blend in. we would have had all that bridge traffic.]
87,6,3,[She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen? Your friend Noreen. Are you sure youre not just flattering yourself? If I was flattering myself I think Id come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen. I cannot believe that she was hitting on you. If you dont believe me ask her. I will. Besides shes got a boyfriend Jerry you know him. Dan. Remember we went to that party at his house? Oh right. The guy who talks with a really high voice. Yeah. Jerry did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail? Check the pile. (leafing through Jerrys mail) Oh who sent you a card? I dont know. Open it its from Hallmark. Oh. Hello darling. Isnt that cute a thank you card from Kristin. Let me see. Whos Kristin? She works for PBS I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive. Did you ask her about me? Yeah in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone. Giddy-up! Alright! So now how does that work? Now what I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in right? No its not aluminum siding its volunteer work. All the money goes to the station. Okay yeah alright that sounds good but I still get a tote bag though right? Yeah and one of those foam beer can holders. (dialing the phone) You know what Im doing? Im calling Noreen. Oh go ahead. You sure you dont mind? Like shes really going to admit she was flirting with me. Hello? Hi its Elaine. Listen I was just talking to Jerry. Jerry? Jerry Seinfeld. Oh I like Jerry a lot. You mean like like? What are you talking about? Noreen were you hitting on him? Noreens not here this is Dan. Ooh. You say that Noreen was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld? Uh oh. So was I right? She likes me right? Oh Im sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello? Elaine? What is going on? Why did you tell Dan I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld? Is this Noreen? (Noreen) What would ever possess you to make up a story like that. Well listen Jerry mentioned it and I dont know-- Noreen are you crying? No this is Dan! Oh hi Dan. Elaine? Work? Tell Noreen Ill just call her back later. Who was crying? No one. Im sorry Mr. Pitt that wont happen again. (unwrapping a candy bar placing it on a plate and cutting it with knife and fork) Im sure it wont but someone was crying and I want to know who it was. Well its a long story okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know hitting on him and so I called her to see what was uh going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend who is this you know-- Im Jerry Seinfeld I tell jokes for a living but theres no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now. Jerry I am so grateful that youre doing this. Oh I know you are. You got the card I sent? I did. So where is it? What? The card. Is this it in the trash? No? This is my card you threw it away. Well-- I put a lot of thought into this card. You signed your name and you addressed the envelope its not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem. Fine. I gotta get back to the office. Why because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it? You have no sentimentality. I have sentimentality really Im sentimental. Here look. Heres some cards Ive saved these are birthday cards from my grandmother see Im not a bad guy. Oh so you save her cards but not mine! Oh great! (as Kristin is storming out) Well but you see I saved something! See? I can save. Ill see you at the pledge drive ok? New cards huh? No theyre old cards from my grandmother. Oh. Well Ill tell you a nice greeting card can really lift a persons spirits. Yeah. (opening a card) Oh a check. Yeah she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday thats why I save them. Theres a check in all these? Why dont you cash them? I dont know its ten dollars. But you got a whole pile here. 1987? Oh so what. Jerry your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money to have the fun that she cant have. Oh this is tantamount to a slap in the face. Oh get out of here. Jerry a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesnt blossom. Alright alright Ill cash the checks. Yeah. It was a thank you card from Kristin because Im doing the PBS drive. I mean how long am I supposed to keep it? The rule is a minimum of two days. You making that up or do you know what youre talking about? Im making it up. I mean really whats the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel. Oh well a mantels a whole different story. Absolutely. If my parents had a mantel I might be a completely different person. So anyway shes kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor. Lets have it. Well Im doing the PBS show so during the show theyre gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me... You want me to ask one of the Yankees. Could you? Alright. Ill run it by a few people. Alright Do your thing where you lie to everyone. (entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call. Hey did you ever get to talk to Noreen? Yes shes very upset. So was I right about the flirting? Was it true? I dont know I never asked. She was yelling-- Who was flirting with you? Remember when we were in the bookstore that woman came up to us? She wasnt flirting with you. Oh sure she was; Asked me where the humor section was? Humor? Come on. Jerry her brother just had a book of political cartoons published. Alright so maybe she wasnt flirting with me. So what? So yeah thats funny. Hey you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork. Really? Yeah. Why does he do that? He probably doesnt want to get chocolate on his fingers. Thats the way these society types eat their candy bars. Oh you know. What you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this? Thats the extra toast. Get it? Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here? What? Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger. Thats how waitress types express derision. They dont want to get their mouths dirty. So what do you think? A PBS fundraiser? Im not gonna waste any of the players time with that besides the team already does so much promotion for channel eleven. Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven. Uh what the hell are you doing? I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it with your hands? You know maybe George has something here about PBS. Okay sixty bucks from Nana. Huh? Yeah. Hello? Hello this is Chemical Bank. Just wanted you to know that your checking account is overdrawn. Chemical Bank? I havent used that account in months. Well someones been cashing the checks and youre overdrawn. Oh dear. Ill be down there first thing in the morning. (unheard by Nana as she hangs up the phone) Wait we can do this over the phone. You got Danny Tartabull?! You wanted a Yankee I got you a Yankee. Boy you really came through. Kristins gonna be thrilled. Hey the Bull owes me one I helped him with his swing. So youre bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight. Absolutely. Pending approval of the script. Excuse me? Jerry Im Yankee management. Yeah Id like to see the script too. Youre just answering phones! It would put me at ease. Hey when you order from the waitress get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses. Uh say I wanted a side order of fruit but I didnt see it on the men Oh youre getting it (pointing to menu with index finger) it comes with your breakfast special. Right you are. I didnt get the special but Id also like the fresh fruit too. (scratching cheek with middle finger) Ill check. (after waitress walks away) I dont believe it she did it again! Oh she had an itch. She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me. By the way lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nanas birthday checks. Looking for something lady? Isnt the Chemical Bank on this block? The bank? It burned. Its gone! Oh dear. (answering) Hello? Jerry? Hello. Uncle Leo! Listen I dont want to alarm you but your nana is missing. Nanas missing? I came to pick her up for a doctors appointment she wasnt here. I called the doctor nobody knows where she is. She hasnt left the apartment in twenty-five years! Ive been thinking about her I just cashed some of her checks. Yeah thats right. You did. What kind of checks? I think Chemical Bank. Oh they were Chemical. Chemical?! She hasnt used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway? Well Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks! Hey I didnt twist your arm. Your grandmothers on a very fixed income. What are you broke? Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks the checks bounced and now my Nanas missing! Well dont look at me. Its your fault! My fault? Your Nana is missing because shes been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people. So anyway its caused a lot of problems. Dan thinks Im interested in Jerry he wont let up. Im really sorry but you can see why Id make a mistake like that. No why? Well you know because hes a high talker. He does raise his voice occasionally but thats normal. No. No no no not a loud talker a high talker. Really? You dont think his voice sounds a lot like yours? I never noticed that. Well its no big deal you know its just that he can sound like a woman you know? Great. Im going out with a man who sounds like a woman. Well he looks like a man. Yeah. Hes bald. I know thats a guy thing. I guess. I know he belches a lot. Well thats something. So Jerry thought I was flirting with him. Yeah. (cutting into a cookie with a knife and fork) Hm. Hes kind of a baritone isnt he? What are you doing? Im eating this cookie. No no no but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just No Ive seen people do it. I like it. This isnt gonna take long is it? Oh no in and out I made sure of that. And youll be happy to know I perused the script and its met with my approval. Im sure its fine. (swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger! You sure? Oh yeah! Middle finger straight up at me! At us! What are you doing? Im following him. And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is Would you? Any word from Nana? No. Nana? Yeah my grandmas missing. Missing? Yeah.

Hmm whats he doin in the city today? You didnt ask him? (suspicious) You didnt say hello? Well he was with someone. A man... In a cape. Why was he wearing a cape? Was my father wearing a cape? No. Jacket and tie: no cape. Huh... Cape... (turns distracted heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?...

(stands puzzled its not sinking in) W-what do you mean? I mean: Im Donna Chang. (pause) Youre Donna Chang? Did you think I was Chinese?... Oh. No. What you mean because of the Chang? Actually the family name wasnt originally Chang. I didnt think so. Used to be Changstein. Shes not Chinese? No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian. So. What is she? Well shes... like you. (pause annoyed) Oh how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch with her cereal) Well its false advertising see? And the thing is I think she likes people thinkin shes Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as Donna Chang... So then why are you seeing her again... Well she is a woman. Listen I spoke to Paul an Noreen. They might be breakin up. Really? (sits on couch) Well maybe. Hey wouldnt it be funny if Paul an Noreen broke up because o you kept hangin up on him? (pause) What do you mean? Well you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin up because he was having an affair with Noreen? Here take my Jockey shorts. Whoa! Whoa! Here what is that?!! Look you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts. Wha--you have a low sperm count? Very low! Come on Jerry. Take em. Nnnoo--I dont want em.

I dont want em! All it takes is one pair! Now come on! J-- Im not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house! Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--theyre baggin up theyre rising in! An theres nothing holding me in place! Im flippin! Im floppin! What am I gonna do!? Jerry! Im goin CRAZY in these things! (leaves) (re the underwear pile) Well Im gonna have to move now. Ya know what I like about Manhattan? Theres no mosquitoes. Plenty of mosquitoes. Queens is full of mosquitoes. So Dad... Gnats too. If Im not mistaken. (pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day! (angry) Your mother has to tell you every move I make?! Jerry and Elaine saw you. They didnt say hello? Well they were in a rush. They couldnt just say hello?!... Oh to hell with them. They uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?... Elaine I can see not sayin hello. Shes very--whats the word--uh supercilious. So Dad-- (shouting and clapping hands in anger) How could Jerry not say Hello?!! Did they uncross the lines yet? No they cant find the problem. Its really getting ridicurous. (long pause -- did he hear ridicurous -- should he say something -- cant decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say ridicurous? Ridiculous. (pause) I thought you said... ridicurous. (Donna looks puzzled) Hey-- (spots Donna) Oh what are you doing here? Oh I wanted to talk to you--Im sorry I--didnt know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya Im George. Oh! Hi! (they shake hands) Im Donna Chang. (George to himself registers that as weird. He and Jerry exchange sideways glances) I just spoke to your mother before. You spoke to my mother? She was trying to call you but-- The rines are crossed? Did you say The rines are crossed? Did I? (pause) George shes so sweet. We talked for an hour! (smile) Yeah. Anyway Im really sorry. Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about? Well she told me she and your father are getting divorced. Ay divorced. Thats really too bad... Yeah you know its a shame his parents didnt get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal. Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an live in two separate places? Thats twice as many visits! Gee I never thought of that. Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! Its like runnin a double marathon! Hey Georgie did you have any idea that anything was wrong? Have you ever spent any time with these people...? You know what this has to do with? What? The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I dont trust men in capes. And you cant cast aspersions on someone just because theyre wearin a cape... Superman wore a cape... An Ill be damned if Im gonna stand here an let you say something bad about him. All right Supermans the exception. Oh hey! Elaine I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) Ive always had a thing for Noreen. No Kramer. You dont understand. This could be my fault. Well if shes available now Im not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance) Well it looks like youve adjusted to the boxers... Wellll I wouldnt go as far as that. You went back to the Jockeys? Wrong again. (pause as he realizes) Oh no. What? What?... Dont you see whats goin on here???... No boxers no Jockeys... (backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww... The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer say it isnt so. Oh it be so. Im out there Jerry an Im lllovin every minute of it!!! Dont you need a little... help? Surprisingly no. Im freee Im unfettered... (opens door to leave still very happy then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin the countryside!! (exits) So you guys are tryin to work it out! Thats great!... Yeah well... Were trying... But he just went insane there for a while... Oh he went insane?... Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered! What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over? (awkward increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I dont know about sick. I mean maybe it was somebody who didnt wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat an was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didnt want to speak to them ah! (has been growing increasingly slackjawed in amazement) I cant believe that was you... (looks at Noreen) Im really sorry Noreen... (reconsidering Pauls worth) ...So you thought he was boring? Hey Noreen dont go by me! Ha ha. What are you doin to this woman?! This is the second relationship youve ruined for her in a few weeks!! (head in arms) I know-- First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker. Well... I got confused they sound exactly the same. So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An then just as theyre reconciling you announce to the world: Hes Boring. (apologetically) I didnt know shed take it so seriously. Well apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman: anything you say she does! Yeah. Its Donna Chang. (hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little) Well I guess I just didnt realize it... Well lets look back at your history with this woman. Okay? (like a little girl) Okay... First you encouraged her to join the army... She did. She was lost... Then you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did! Well she didnt seem to be havin so much fun... You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge... If I have this much influence over her why dont I just call her an tell her to get back together with him--thats aalll! Hi. Oh Miss Changstein! This is Elaine... Helllo...--ELAINE: Hi! How are you?) (to Jerry) Guess what? Mrs. Costanza called me theyre not getting divorced. (happy gasp) Oh. Why? What happened? Well she was trying to call George last night she got me we spoke for an hour and she changed her mind!!! Wow! Thats amazing! Anyway she wants to meet me! She invited me over for dinner! (off camera) Huh. She said you should come too. Tonight? Yeah--I just remembered Im gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class. (goes to phone) All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think Im going to two Thanksgivings youre out of your mind!!! (calmly) Were not getting divorced. Your mother changed her mind... (tries to catch a fly with his hand) (gleeful to Estelle) You did?! Thats Goood! Thats very good! Im very glad to hear that. Yeah we worked it out. All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape? He was my lawyer. Your lawyer wears a cape...? Yeah. So what? Who wears a cape? Hes very independent; he doesnt follow the trends. He looks ridiculous in that thing... (shouting) You have no eye for fashion!!! (shouting) I have no eye for fashion?!?!?! All right! Come on! Lets not fight. All right! All right! Georgies right. (pats him on the cheek) (quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind? It was that Chinese woman. So Im curious. Whatd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind? I mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius. Confucius huh? Yeah. (pause) You know youre not Chinese... Hey! I heard the good news! Jerry how come you didnt say hello to me the other day huh?! Elaine was... in a rush. (to George pointing) I knew it was Elaine!! You must be Estelle. (giggles) Yes. Who are you...? Im Donna Chang! (steps back appalled) Youre not Chinese! Yello? Paul? Elaine! Kramer? (pause) YEAHH! What are you doin there? Wellll isnt it obvious? (scoffs) Uh is Noreen there? Yes she is... (pause) Well... Can I talk to her? Oh what? Am I... tooo boring for you? (losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on? Well I feel that it would be best that you didnt talk to Noreen for a while... YOU feel? Thats right! She an I have had a very long talk. An I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence youve had over her life lo these many years... What are you insane?! From now on Ill be calling the shots around here... Uh! Ho-ho. An what are YOU gonna tell her? Well. Ive encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There shell get the structure an the discipline she needs right now... And shell have qualified officers telling her what to do... (sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her! Cant help ya kid. Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down) Youre not Chinese!?!? ...No. I thought you were Chinese!! Im from Long Island. Long Island?!?! I thought I was gettin advice from a Chinese woman!! Im sorry...? Well... then... that changes everything! What?! Shes not Chinese; I was duped!! So what?! She still gave you advice; whats the difference if shes not Chinese?!?! Im not taking advice from some girl from Long Island!! (goes into another room) (chases after her) Wait a minute! Youre--now youre getting a divorce because shes from Long Island?!?! (shouts after them) You want a divorce?!!? You got one!!! (pause to Donna) You know you might wanna think about changin your name... So ever since she started dating Kramer she wont even talk to me! Well--Noreen listened to you like Georges mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine) (pause) You know everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean look at the fortune cookie. You couldnt get away with that in any other restaurant. (quietly) hu_uh (pause) You know everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean look at the fortune cookie. You couldnt get away with that in any other restaurant. Yeah no ones reading any rolled-up messages in a knish... Oh it had to happen!! Hey. I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! Im runnin all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--its like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played Clue! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)] (triumphant) Hey Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreens late! Shes laaate!! (give two thumbs up) (surprised) Who are you?! Im Frank Costanzas lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety)]
89,6,5,[So she got you to join a book club? I got a feeling Im gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon. Well I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey what about this one? Nah I dont like that one. So whats your first book? Breakfast At Tiffanys. 90 pages. (Waves a hand like its nothing.) Its kinda old isnt it? They wanted to read a Truman Capote book. Oh sure...Truman Capote. Hes a great writer. Oh yeah. Did you ever read anything by him? No. You? Nah. Oh what about this one? Look at this this is it! This is what Im looking for. (Sits on the couch.) Oh yeah! Hey whats going on? New couch baby! New couch? Why? I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesnt fold out so no one can sleep over. Hello. Hello. Oh let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh be careful! Wait till you see it its perfect. The guy told me its one of a kind they stopped making it. What are you doing with your old couch? Nothing the moving guys are taking it. Why you want it? Yeah Ill take it. Well Im sure that they can deliver it to your apartment. Yes they can. (Kramer enters.) Hey! Couch is comin. Its here! Alright! Yeah. You know Im excited about this Jerry. In a way I feel like Im getting a new couch. Yeah. So do I. Ooh! Remember Poppie? Oh you mean from Poppies Restaurant? Yeah yeah. Anyway uh...were going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza? Yeah. What was that again? Its a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough the sauce the cheese...you pound it slap it you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good huh? Ooh I cant wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie! What made you resurrect that old idea? Well I happened to be eating at Poppies when I told him the old idea and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know he wants to back it. I heard Poppies was good lets go. Im not goin there. Didnt he get busted by the Board of Health? That was in the past Jerry. As it happens New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there you think you died and went to heaven. Ooh! I love duck. Cmon cmon! Yeah but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know Im gonna call him Im gonna order the duck for you. Oh Kramer I - Right there guys. Thats perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think Lainie? Well I dont know. Ill have to sit on it. Oh no I dont want anyone sitting on it. Sign here. Excuse me I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? Its not very far. Sure. Kay. You uh...you got room in the truck for me? Yeah I think we can squeeze you in. Oh goody. Okay well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...Ill see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.) Did you offer those guys a drink? Uh no. Should I have? What kind of a person are you? I dont know. Okay. Breakfast At Tiffanys. (Begins to read but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes theres a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch and doesnt start the book.) So he puts the couch down and just as hes about to leave he says Do you date moving men? Ah ha... You wanna know what I said? I cant wait. I do now. Clever. Is that something? Yes. Is that something? Youre something. So anyway when they were in my house before I didnt offer them anything to drink. Well theyre real men Jerry. They get sweaty. So anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink? Yes. Well would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.) Hello! Jerry so good to see you again! (Puts his hand out.) Hello Poppie. This is Elaine. Nice to meet you Poppie. Let me show you to your table. (Leads Jerry and Elaine to the table.) Your duck is cooking as we speak. It is so succulent...so succulent! Well Kramer told us all about your business venture together. Your friend and I are going to make a lot of money. Of course I already have a lot of money. Poppie does very well...very well. Well your mother must be very proud of you. My mother...was taken from my house by the Communists in the middle of the night when I was ten years old. She was sent to a slave labor camp where she labored for twelve years. Finally they released her and she was on a boat to America to re-unite with us...but she was served some bad fish and she died...on the high seas. So whats good tonight? Boy Im really looking forward to this duck. Ive never had food ordered in advance before. Ah I couldve stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccinos. Paccinos? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccinos. Why not? Because the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical anti-abortion groups. So you wont eat the pizza? No way. Really. Yeah. Well what if Poppie felt the same way? Well I guess I wouldnt eat here then. Really! Yeah. Thats right. Well perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.) Yes Jerry. I just checked your duck...it is more succulent than even I had hoped. Poppie I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue? When my mother was abducted by the Communists she was with child... Oh boy. ...but the Communists they put an end to that! So on this issue there is no debate! And no intelligent person can think differently. Well...Poppie. I think differently. And what gives you the right to do that? The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Lets go Jerry cmon. I heard that. Lets go Henry. But we just got here... Im with you Poppie! Lets go! And I am not coming back! Youre not welcome! Well Im certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.) Well you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there. Im sorry I missed it. Oh you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So hows the book coming? (Georges laughs taper off...) I say hows the book comin? Oh...pretty good. So whats it about? Well its about Holly Go-Lightly. Holly Go-Lightly. Yeah shes quite a character. Yes you havent read a page have you? No. Big surprise. I couldnt. You know if its not about sports I find it very hard to concentrate. Youre not very bright are you? No Im not. I would like to be but Im not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days. Why dont you rent the movie? Why dont I rent the movie. See this is when I like you. Alright now Im relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.) So...how was the dinner last night? Oh...well... Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night. Oh...well... Alright what did you do to Poppie? Nothing. Well hes in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there. Whats wrong with him? I dont know! Im gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this and leaves.) We should get him something. Yeah. Youre right. Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So what do you think of my conversation? Not much! (They both laugh.) I uh would have invited you up but I dont have any furniture. You dont have any furniture? No I hate furniture. I cant look at it. (They laugh again.) Well I can understand that. Pretty good date huh? Yeah! No heavy lifting. (Elaine and Carl look into each others eyes then kiss.) Anyway Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you and they wanted you to have this. Whats this? A bottle of wine and a five-alarm chili? Theyre trying to kill Poppie?! Why what...? Dont they know I have a gastro-intestinal disorder? If I would have any of this I would die. Then Poppies no good to anyone! This is a sick sick joke on Poppie. How could you be friends with those two? Well were not very close. They owe me for those ducks. They were flown in from Newfoundland. Oh they got good ducks there huh? Oh very good ducks. Im in looove! Whoa! This is it Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! Hes real hes honest hes unpretentious...oh Im really lucky! Did you tell him I was sorry I didnt offer him the drink? No I forgot. And the best part is he doesnt play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.) No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if youre winning or losing? Well all I know is he doesnt like games and he doesnt play games you know? He has too much character and integrity. Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion? What? What is his stand...on abortion? Well Im sure hes pro-choice. How do you know? Because he well...hes just so good-looking. Well you should probably ask because if hes gonna be coming over with those Paccinos pizzas...could be trouble. Id like to rent Breakfast At Tiffanys. Uh this is out. Someone has it. Out? Oh no Ive been to four other places youre the only ones that have had it. Well I could put it on reserve for you if youd like. Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it. Oh sorry. We cant do that. Well maybe theyre done with it. I could go pick it up. I dont think so. It doesnt work that way. Yes? Uh excuse me are you Joe Temple? Yes. Uh yes uh...you dont know me my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffanys? Hey. Hey whats happenin. Well you know Poppies over at my place. Tonights the big night. Im gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant. You got a regular Manhattan Project going on over there. Yeah. Anyway hes about to leave he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.) Okay. Hi Poppie. Hello. Im sorry about the gift I didnt know about your condition. Thats fine. If you just give me my duck money Ill be on my way. Okay. Ill get it. (Goes into the bedroom.) Why dont you sit down Poppie? Youre still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What are you tired Poppie? No. Hey Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza? Kramer did I ever tell you about my mother? My mother - Here you go. (Poppie stands up and takes the money.) Anyway Im sorry again about the...(notices a large wet stain on his couch)...the...the... The what? (Looks at Kramer and exits.) ...the...the... So long. Ill see you tonight. Kramer Kramer what is this?! What is what? This puddle on my sofa! What puddle? That puddle! (Kramer sees the puddle and does a double-take.) I dont know. Is it...? Could it...? Could he have...? IT IS! (Grabs Kramer.) Poppie peed on my sofa!! Are you sure? Well what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa! Im sure itll come out. I dont care if it comes out I cant sit on that anymore! Ah youre making too much of it. Yeah youre right. Its just a natural human function...happens to be on my sofa instead of in the toilet where it would normally be. Right! Well anyway the book club meets tomorrow Mr. Temple. Well I was going to watch it with my daughter. She likes Audrey Hepburn very much. She was a delicate flower. Why didnt you just read the book? Well as I say the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joes daughter comes to the door.) Remy this is George. Would you mind if he watched Breakfast At Tiffanys with us? (George smiles at Remy. Remy looks at Joe doubtfully.) Hi. Hi. (They kiss.) I missed you. Oh I missed you! I dont remember the last time I felt this way. Me either! I think about you all the time. You do? Do you think about me? Oh yeah all the time all the time...although recently Ive been thinking about this friend of mine. What friend? Oh just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carls response will be.) You know someday...were going to get enough people in the Supreme Court to change that law. So anything to uh nosh? What did you want? Popcorn? Popcorn? Where do you think you are? Well a lot of people keep popcorn in the house. Well we dont. You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable thats all. Heres some nuts. Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How theres two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert. Can we watch the movie now Daddy? (Joe presses play on the remote.) Hey lets turn off the lights get some real movie atmosphere. The lights are fine. (George shrugs and the movie begins.) See anybody can do this. (Tosses pizza dough into the air.) Use your wrist! Its all in the wrist. (Kramer tosses the dough way up there.) Not too high! Alright put a little sauce on here... (speaks some unintelligible words in an Italian accent while spreading the sauce around.) Some cheese... Not too much! And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.) Wait a second...what is that? Its cucumbers. No no. You cant put cucumbers on a pizza. Well why not? I like cucumbers. Thats not a pizza. Itll taste terrible. But thats the idea you make your own pie. Yes but we cannot give the people the right to choose any topping they want! Now on this issue there can be no debate! What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie? Because its a pizza! Its not a pizza until it comes out of the oven! Its a pizza the moment you put your fists in the dough! No it isnt! Yes it is! Im home. Hey honey. Hi Mom. Hi baby. (To George.) Hello. Breakfast At Tiffanys? Yeah. Well I just came back from Angelas its not looking very good for Duncan. Aw thats too bad. Yeah the doctor thinks its just a matter of time - Joe...could you... Poor guy I hate to see him suffer like this... You know Im sorry I...I hate to be one of those people but were right in the middle of this thing...I cant hear. Who are you? This is George Costanza. This is very hard to follow with all the talking. Ill pause it okay? (Pauses the tape with the remote.) Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.) Who is this guy? Hes in some book club. And whats he doing here? Cheating on his test. (George returns from the kitchen with a glass of grape juice.) So we watching the movie or are we still talking? (Joes wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay cmon. Lets go. What? Cmon you took my seat. Its not your seat. I was sitting there cmon. You didnt save it. I had the arm! Joe... Whats the difference? Well I was very comfortable! Ive got my nuts here... Its my couch. Alright cmon scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.) Look! Look what you did! You got grape juice all over our couch youve ruined our couch! (Joe slowly walks toward George with his hands on his hips.) Joe... Oh my god. You see?! So youre gonna get a new couch? Well I guess I have no choice. Do you want your old couch back? I was hoping youd offer. (The intercom buzzes Jerry answers it.) Yeah? Its the movers. Kay. (Buzzes them in.) Whos that? Your boyfriend hes taking it out. No no hes not my boyfriend. Why? Take a guess. Oh really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.) Hi. Hi. Hey Carl I also need you to go to Elaines and bring my old couch back. Today? Could you? Sure. What are you doing with this couch? George is taking it. Did you tell him it was peed on? He said he doesnt care hell just turn the cushion over. Im sorry you feel that way Elaine. Yeah me too. Its just too bad. Yeah. It is. Well I better get this couch back to Jerrys. Can I offer you anything to drink? Yeah sure. All Ive got is grape juice. Throw it! The couch! She didnt want the constraints of any relationship thats why she got rid of the cat. The most important thing in Hollys life was her independence. Well not really. After all she did get together with George Peppard. I mean Fred. George...Freds gay.]

No youd have to be crazy. He was a very bad dictator. Yes. Very bad. Very very bad. So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an &eacute;clair in the receptacle. And you think to yourself What the hell Ill just eat some trash. No no. No no no. It was not trash! Was it in the trash? Yes. Then it was trash. It wasnt down in it was sort of on top. But it was in the cylinder! Above the rim. Adjacent to refuse is refuse. It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on. Was it eaten? One little bite. Well thats garbage. But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt! Well you my friend have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum. Hey! Hey. Whats with you? I got a stone. What stone? A kidney stone. What is that anyway? Its a its a stony mineral concretion formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. Its forced out through the urine! Oh thats gotta hurt. Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger including the stock swap. Ah. The stock swap. Lets swap some stock. (giggles) And if youll just give this to Mr. Pitt and tell him we expect to be in full-scale production by the spring. All right. (standing up) Hey you guys--whats the name of the new company gonna be? Moland Spring. (making a face) Moland? Yes we combined Morgan and Poland. Yeah I know but... Moland? I wouldnt drink anything called Moland. But it was Mr. Pitts idea. Oh! Well ah whats in a name? I mean waters water. Right? (to Beck) Weve got to do something about that name. (on phone as Jerry gestures beside him) No Lindsay it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen can I tell you something else? In my family we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. Thats right. Oh okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) Im back in she gave me a second chance. Good for you. Yes good for me! Yknow what you should do now? Get her some flowers smooth it out. Yes flowers. I will get her flowers I will go to the florist! (enters apartment holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the 84 Olympiad! Katyas silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR sets up TV) Kramer are you still on this? Ive seen gymnasts. I know what they do. Its not going to make any difference. Jerry what is your problem? Kramer yknow guys like you with no conscience dont know what its like for guys like me. Im in the unfortunate position of having to consider peoples feelings. All right Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra? No. Tantric yoga? No. Jerry you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of! Boy you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess thats better than eating it. All right all right why dont we just watch the tape? (starts playback) All right. Did you pass your stone yet? Not yet. But the suspense is killing me. (pointing at TV) Hey thats her! Oh yeah. Oh yeah thats her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height Jerry the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand half-turn giant into a straddle back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh nice leg extension good form! Now here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation full in double back and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch mouths agape) Perhaps youd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well Ill take that as a yes. (smiling and excited) Well here we are. Yes. We are here. How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean its only this wide! I can balance myself in any position. It is amazing after years of training how one can contort ones body. Of course it is only useful in gymnastics. Oh boy... I couldnt believe it. Uh I mean I thought I was entering a magical world of sensual delights but it was just so ordinary. I mean there was nothing gymnastic about it. Well what did you think she was gonna do? Well you know. I mean... I dunno. No what? Well obviously I prefer not to mention any you know... What did you think she was going to take some of that chalk and... You see now I really dont want to get into this any kind of specifics... Oh come on. One thing? One thing! What? Well... Frankly I thought you know I was gonna kinda be like the apparatus. You mean like the uneven parallel bars? See again I really dont feel that... The balance beam? Could we stop? (gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse? All right. Lets just drop it. So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in now because of you know last night. I dunno at least three weeks. (sarcastic) Oh great. Jerry that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger. Between Poland and Morgan? Yeah. Started a big name controversy. Kramer! The stone! What happened did you pass the stone? (Off-screen) No I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didnt make it. (singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) ...tootsie good-bye. Too-too tootsie... (takes a drink makes a face shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him accidentally hitting a parked cars windshield) Hey! What the hell was that?! Im sorry! Im terribly sorry! I- I- Clean that up! Oh sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um uh could you hold these? For just a second just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin begins wiping windshield) Here you go now dont worry about a thing. Its gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine. (sees George cleaning car windshield looks appalled) Look at this sparkle. (looks up sees Lindsays mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright! (on phone as Jerry gestures beside him) No Lindsay I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentlemans windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well did she see a squeegee? Well youre not going to make a dime without a squeegee. Thats right thats right just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You wont regret it. Okay Ill see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up) Strike two! You think Im going down? Youre behind in the count. I know. (enters apartment points at Jerry) Hey what are you doing later? Im going out with Katya thanks to you. Well maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time: people are a little shy a little reticent. If I do it again that extends my payment book another two weeks. All right where you going? Were going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I dont even feel like going out. Well Jerry its your obligation. Cmon. Yeah well yknow what? If I gotta go and spend time with this girl then youre coming with me Dr. Cyclops! No no no I dont wanna go to the circus Jerry. Yeah well youre going. Yeah but Im afraid of clowns! (in polo outfit complete with jacket and high boots) I didnt send you over there to complain about the name. Well I couldnt help it. Moland Spring? I like the name Moland. I picked it out. After all those months of negotiating! Well Im so sorry! I- Well Im going riding. I havent been on Jenny for three days all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine? Oh sorry. (picks up phone) Hello? (walks by 3-D poster stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Ah! So Jerry youre enjoying the circus? Greatest Show on Earth! My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came by he would scream curses at them blaming them for all the ills of society. Well they certainly take up a lot of space. Ah Misha! Katya! Misha this is Jerry. Ah yes. The co-me-dian eh? (speaks in Romanian to Katya) (laughs replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry) (on phone) Oh yes yes Ill tell him. Yes thank you. Um um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt! (staring at 3-D poster) I think Im on to something! Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. Theyve called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger! You said keep your eyes out of focus which is misleading. You want DEEP focus! (on phone) Yes hi. Okay fine yeah hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah Ive got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah yeah hell be there. (drops phone rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt you have GOT to stop staring at that poster! I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointy? (grabs poster smashes it) No you dont see it and youre never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt you have to meet with the shareholders you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?! Hmm whats happened to me? (straightens lapels) Whens the meeting? In about twenty minutes. Oh! (puts finger to face smearing ink on his upper lip which now resembles an Adolph Hitler-style moustache) Do I have time to change? Um no. Well excuse me Id better get straight over there. Uh Mr. Pitt... Yes? Um theres a just... (points at her own upper lip) (sees Elaines hands covered in ink) Is that ink? No? Well here we are. Do you want to come in? My mothers having a little party. Maybe I could just use the bathroom. Sure. (voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen could I direct your attention to the center ring where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb. It is time. Well break a leg. Eh show biz... Ladies and gentlemen the incomparable Misha! Boy those capes are really coming back. (exits bathroom finds George waiting) Oh sorry I took so long. Theyve got one of those 3-D art posters in there. (wipes eyes) Its mesmerizing. What is that sound? (covering ears) It is horrible! Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird wild stuff huh? Whew! I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring at any cost! AND... our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand) Hell be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I dont want you to come with me. Oh why not? It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that was all the time I needed to put in. Really? In my country they speak of a man so virile so potent that to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the Comedian. You may tell jokes Mr. Jerry Seinfeld but you are no Comedian. (walks off)]
91,6,7,[O.K. Cowboys (taps pencil on her pad) Whatll you have? Ill have the ah turkey club without the bacon. And ah Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows) George dont make me get tough with you. Why you think you can beat me up? You wouldnt want me to mess up the beautiful face of yours. Huh nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu then flicks it into the air) You dont want bacon Ill surprise you. (she turns and walks away) Wow is she not terrific? She does have a way. You think she thinks I have a beautiful face or is she just saying that? Well they do work on tips. George dont make me get tough with you. Whu hu hu hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me? Ah I should have got the egg white omelet. Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh theres a million people to like. The omelet. Damn. Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible? No. No. Not possible. Not possible. Heyyyyyy (leaning in very friendly and happy) Hey Elaine. Lannie how was the trip? What trip? You were gone? I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt for 5 days. Hunh pph (raises hands slightly in amazement) How was it? Actually it was great. I met an Englishman and we really hit it off. Yeah well that relationships really got a lot of potential. he he (laughs) Yeah well Jerome I happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles. Flying him in? How longs he staying for? Its an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants. All this in 5 days. Hmm. Oh no its Kenny Bania. Whos he? (quietly) Oh hes this awful comedian. Hey Jerry. Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm just to be polite) Elaine George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm) Hi. (she flips her hair) Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi) Hi. (to Elaine) Hows it going? Great. Ive been working out. Went from a size 40 to a 42. No kidding. Yeah Im huge (ducks his head into his right shoulder with false modesty) Well Ill leave you guys alone. (raps his knuckle twice on the table turns and walks away) All right. O.K. Thanks. Oh. Jerry You know what just hit me? I was thinking -- What size suit are you? Ahh Im a 40. Why? I just got a brand new Armani suit -- doesnt fit me anymore. You want it? Well I dont know if I ... Oh come on. Why should it just sit in the closet? An Armani suit? Take the suit. Well ... ok I guess (voice trailing off) You gonna be home later? Yeah. Ill drop it off. (raps his knuckle twice on the table again turns and walks away) Heh heh heh hey new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast) Yeah yeah lucky me. (sips coffee) (to George) Here I personally made you a cold chicken sandwich. Its not even on the menu. (takes a large bite - with his mouth still full his speech is muffled) Oh this is fabulous. Boy she is nice. I like her I like her Jerry. Shes got substance. She oozes substance. Well go in there and talk to her. Shes not going to put em on the glass. You mean a walk back in? Thats the toughest move in the business. Youre sending me out into no-mans-land and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I cant do it! I cant do it I tell ya! Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! Thats an order! Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant) Hey. (walking over to Jerry who sits at the table reading the newspaper) Hey. Listen I need you to do me a favor. What? Well I need you to help me move my refrigerator. Why? Cause Im getting rid of it. YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom) [Its K.B. I have the suit] ALL RIGHT COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - hes not looking forward to Kenny Bania) (claps hands) So ... Well well why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen) Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. Its gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space. What for? Well I could put a dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast. Hey (holds the Armani suit up) Here you go. (walks into the apt.) Yeah. You didnt think I was really going to give you a suit did you? What youre giving him this suit? Thats right and its an Armani. Armani? Hey Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over) Yes yes I heard. Come on try it on. No its ok. Come on I want to see how it fits. All right all right. (trying on the suit jacket) There you go. Ok Yeah all right. Oh boy that looks great. I cant believe youre giving him this. I dont even want anything for it. Hes very generous isnt he? Yes yes he is. Ill tell you what -- you can take me out to dinner sometime. Dinner? Yeah. You buy me a meal -- you cant get a better deal than that (pats Jerry on the shoulder) No youll never get a better deal than that. All right. Ill leave you alone. (turns and walks out the door) Yeah Ill see you. All right ooh look at that Armani huh yeah. Yeah thats a deal. Thats a terrible deal. I dont want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit. I did it! Its all done! Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement) I did it. Hunh were going out as soon as she gets off of work and itll still be daytime. You know I Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. its less pressure. I love the day date. No wine No shower. There ya go. So the trip was good? Yes (nice English accent) Apart from that dreadful airline food. It tends to reek havoc with my stomach. You know I I have to say Ive never admitted this to anyone but um I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs flirting with him) Thats probably because of ... [muttering] What? What? Yeah what? [sighs] What? Where I come from we dont say What? Its proper to say Pardon? Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting. Pardon? Nothing. So then about a year ago I started selling these funky little hair clips. Its going pretty good. I make them in my apartment. Im just doing this waitress thing for a while because I wanted to go to Europe this summer... (quietly) ahh. ...and I could use a few extra ... Careful Oh. Its just horse manure (huh huh - laughs he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manures not that bad. I dont even mind the word manure. You know its its nure which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices manure is actually pretty refreshing. Thats a nice watch George. Yeah. You know my boyfriend has the same one. Huh. Really? Yeah he loves watches. Hes a real watch freak. Well how about that? Ooh look out. (pointing at the ground - squishing sound) You stepped right in it. Yes I sure did. So you just pretended it didnt bother you? What is that Boyfriend? I dont understand that. What what does she think I asked her out for? Boy Its the way they just slip it in there too. Yeah yeah like its just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. Hes a real watch freak. We-e-ell thats fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times) Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out? I said would you like to go for a walk or something. Oh a walk well -- Or something. I said Or Something! Or something. Yeah thats a date. (snaps fingers) There you go. Course you know there is always the possibility that she called an audible. What do you mean? Well she got up to the line of scrimmage didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play. I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation. Uh huh. I mentioned how I liked horse manure. You did? Yeah. Yeah. You said you liked horse manure. Yeah. (quietly) Mm-hm. You know about how when you break it down its really a very positive thing. you know you have a nure with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad. And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend? Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa wa was just saying how it takes a negative thing and puts it on a positive spin on it. Im just saying theres a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure. So you dont think she really has a boyfriend? My honest opinion I think she made it up. Well then shes just a Liar Isnt she? Hey. Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat dont you? Ahh no no no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. Its fun. Very monastic. Well what do you eat? Its all fresh. Fresh fish fresh foul fresh fruit. I buy it I omniga nominga I eat it. Well Im glad its working out. Oh yeah its working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies. Boy if I could meet a hostess we could open up our own place. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah well Ill tell you shes a full-figured gal. Is she? Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George we could double sometime. Yeah yeah yeah we could. You know ah Kramer the next time you talk to her find out if she knows Kelly from Monks. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend. All right its done. Hello? Hi Jerry. Its Kenny. Oh Hi. You know I was thinking if youre not busy maybe I can get my meal today? Yeah you wanna get that meal dont you? How about Mendys ooh ever been there? No I havent? Ah youre gonna love it. Ill meet you there around 7:00. All right. Ahh. (hangs up the phone) Yeah I really needed that suit. I start off with curls. Thats good for the bicep. (motions with 2 fingers along his right bicep) I do 10 reps 2 sets. Mm. Thats fantastic. (he could care less) You work out with weights? No I dont. You should. Why? You worn the suit yet? No not yet. have you decided? Oh get the swordfish. Best swordfish in the city. The best Jerry. Ill have the salmon. And you? Ahh you know what I think. Im just going to have soup. Yeah Ill save the meal for another time. Another time? What other time? I had a hot dog earlier. Im not that hungry. No no Bania no. This is the dinner. The soup counts. Soups not a meal. Youre supposed to buy me a meal. Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want. But I dont want anything but soup. Then thats the meal. But I had the hot dog. I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog? Hey I give you a brand-new Armani suit and you wont even buy me a meal? All right fine. Get the soup! So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again. What kind of soup did he get? I dont know? Consomm&eacute; or something. Consomm&eacute; hmm. What? Well thats not really a meal Jerry. I mean if he had gotten Chicken Gumbo or Matzah Ball even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups. Elaine youre missing the whole point. What? The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesnt matter what you get as long as hes sitting in that restaurant its a meal. Was it a cup or a bowl? You see -- ah uh ... Im just curious. A bowl ok? Did he crumble any crackers in it? (reiterating the question) Did he crumble any crackers in it? As a mater of fact he did. Oh well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal. Its like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here. Oh hi Simon. This is Jerry. Hello. (to Jerry politely -- then quickly turns to Elaine) Elaine do you have any cash on you? Um yeah in my purse. No. There was only six dollars. Well I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills) Well 20 should cover me. (snatches the cash) Thanks mate. (he walks down the stairs to the sidewalk) Where you going? (starts to turn back to Elaine) Just visiting. Oh OK see you later. I wont be back for dinner. (turns and walks off down the street) (English accent) Pardon? So is she working? Is she here? Yeah yeah shes here. Have you said anything to her? No but Im very uncomfortable. Are you going to say anything? There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no. Hello Hello. Well whats it going to be? Whats it gonna be? Yes. Whatll you have? Are you eating? Its in that vein. Ill eh Ill just have a bowl of chili. Ill have an egg white omelet. Whats it gonna be? ... You hear that? Yeah that was bad. Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - theres no more banter. Oh no its Kenny. Slide out so he cant sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats) Hey. Hey. You worn the suit yet? Actually I did. I put it on last night and slept in it. You did? ... Oh Im joking. OH! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Can I squeeze in? (to George) Sure you can. Can I take your order? What kind of soup do you have? Why dont you get a sandwich? Ok Ill have tomato soup and ah tuna on toast. OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy. What are you talking about? this isnt a meal. Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal. Youre supposed to buy me dinner in a nice restaurant like Mendys. I tried to do that. This is lunch in a coffee shop Doesnt matter This is it. This completes the transaction. Ah soup and a sandwich for a brand-new Armani suit. Is that any kind of gesture? (turns to George) Im really not comfortable ... (to George) Hey I just spoke to ah Hilde about your friend. Yeah. She doesnt have a boyfriend. She made it up. Hi. Hi. Wheres Simon? Oh hell be right up. Hes just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her then sits on the couch) Whens he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator) About 2 days. Although hes hinting at how hed like to stay. Fortunately he has no money and no prospects. (she smiles) Hey mate. Fancy a beer? Ah no thanks. (on the phone) Hello? No Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! Theres no dinner. Theres not going to be any dinner. Youve had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and thats it. Good-bye. Hey what size suit are you? 40. 40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit you want it? Absolutely. Great its yours. I cant stand the sight of it. Elaine heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys) Thanks Yo? Listen Jerry Ive been doing some thinking. I want my suit back. I dont have your suit. I gave it away. Well its my suit. Well its gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania. Hey. Hey. Um yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh uh ... well hows everything? (clap) Ok. Good ah (clap) whats going on? Nothing. Really. You want food dont cha? (nodding his head up and down) Its not for me. Its for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. Shes hungry she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... theres gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence) All right go ahead Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things) Did you find anything! Uh yeah ah ... Theres a few things in here ah peanut butter cheese yeah ... Cheese is good. Yeah what kind? Uh Swiss. All right itll have to do. Come on. What are we doing out here? Arent we going to go in and eat? I cant go in there. Im too uncomfortable. Oh w-what are you saying? So were not going to go in there anymore? Hey What are you doing out here? We cant eat here anymore because he took a waitress out for a walk. Whats the difference? Lets go to Reggies. Reggies? I cant eat anything there. Its the same menu. Theres no Big Salad. Theyll make you a Big Salad. What do you think theyre the only ones that make a Big Salad? All right. Lets go to Reggies. So whats going on with Simon? Did he leave? Ahh ... wait till you hear this. So Simon picks this woman up right in front of me. Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu No egg white omelets. Look at that. So what! Have a yoke! It wont kill you. (walks up to the table) Hello. Oh hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet? Did you read the menu? All right just give me a western. (unhappy) How bout a Big Salad? A big salad? (to George) Ya see? Just tell her whatcha want theyll make it for ya. Its a salad only bigger with lots of stuff in it. I can bring you 2 small salads. Could you put it in a big bowl? We dont have big bowls. All right. Just give me a cup of decaf. We have Sanka. I mean its not fair. Ive been going there for 7 years. Shes been there 3 weeks. Not fair. If anyone should be forced to leave that place it should be her! Shes on your turf. If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired. Youre the best. Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired? Well as I see it youve got to apply the same principles that get you fired but redirected outwardly. H-Hey. Shes hungry Jerry. Well theres nothing left. Theres no food. No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerrys cupboards and refrigerator) -- I cant go back in there with no food. Shes expecting something Jerry. You dont know what shes like when that blood sugar drops. (from Kramers apartment) Food! There you see. Shes already in a bad mood. She just got fired. Whyd she get fired? Oh because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it. So Simon is definitely going back now. Hes meeting me here to return my keys. Boy hes a real bounder isnt he? Yes. Hes one of those bounders. Egg white omelet and Big Salad. AHhh. Thank you. I just wanted you guys know that Fridays my last day. Bloomingdales ordered a bunch of my clips thank God I dont have to do this any more. (turns and walks away) Ah (hu ha - small laugh) Hey Jerry wheres my suit? I dont have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania) (on the phone we assume its George calling) I told you shes busy. She cant come to the phone now! (hangs up) You better tell your boyfriend to stop calling here. Oh hes not my boyfriend. Its that bald guy with the glasses whos always here with them. Hes trying to get me in trouble. HEY! Yeah. I got a message for you. You tell your friend George that the next time I see him around here Im going to turn him into my Own Personal Hand-Puppet. Well hello. Here you are as promised. You see Im a man of my word. (drops keys into Elaines extended palm) When are you leaving? Elaine are you trying to get rid of me? Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I was supposed to leave tomorrow but all of a sudden Ive been set up with a job interview that might enable me to extend my visit indefinitely. And it is all due to this suit. How do I look? Im a shoe-in arent I. Thanks again love. (touches the table turns and walks to the exit) (turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back? (leans backwards from the counter) Yeah! There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door) Hey! Hey! (he runs out the door after Simon; from outside) Come Here You! (from outside Monks) What are you doing? Unhand me! (from outside Monks) Take It Off!]
92,6,8,[George are you sure I cant show you any other cars? I dont think so Vic. Ive done my homework. 89 Volvo thats the car for me its the one I want. I got a LeBaron convertible right here. N.I. Not interested. Its got a few more miles on it but the previous owner was John Voight. Jon Voight? Okay Tim. Youre welcome. (Hangs up.) Was that Tim Whatley? Yes it was. He wanted your address - you my friend are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know hes got that great apartment on 77th street and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macys Thankgiving Day Parade? I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why cant he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.) Oh hes a dentist. You dont want to go out with a dentist. Why? Hell always be criticizing your brushing technique itll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine then enters.) Uh - new car! Ohhh! Hey! Did you get the Volvo? No I decided to go with an 89 LeBaron. A LeBaron? I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car. What Consumer? Im the consumer. Alright. Seems like...a strange choice. Well maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight. Jon Voight? The actor? Thats right. He just happened to be the previous owner of the vehicle. You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight? No no... I think yes yes. You like the idea of telling people youre driving Jon Voights car. Alright maybe I do. So what. Ive never even seen him in a car. I mean look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.) Hey. Hey. Jerry you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well if they dont get some business theyre gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores. I like coffee. I like (imitates Kramer) cookies. Yeah of course you do. And do you know why? Because youre a bunch of yuppies. Its your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood. Well whats so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store I wouldnt shop there. Hey Bogambo - theyve been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now come on Jerry. Youve gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin. I really dont wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled. Well what about sneakers? You know theyll clean em. They do complete detailing. Alright take em. Yeah-yah. Kramer without you wed be out of business. Well you know these sneakers they belong to my neighbor Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian. So many sneakers! Well hes got a Peter Pan complex. Theyll be ready a week from Thursday. Oh well no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh. Whats the matter? Oh I keep getting these nosebleeds. Oh lie down and put your head back. Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey whats with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.) What? Well you got wires sticking out every which way. That looks dangerous you should call the electrician. You know in the 48 years weve been here I dont think weve ever called an electrician. Yeah well you should. This place could blow any minute. Elaine? Yes Mr. Pitt? Have you gotten all the salt off those pretzels yet? No Im still working on it. What in blazes are you listening to? Artie Shaw. Honeysuckle Jump. (The song ends.) That was Artie Shaw Honeysuckle Jump. Elaine! How did you know that? Oh my father used have a huge collection of big band records. Congratulations to our listener Wayne Hopper for identifying it. And by doing so he becomes our seventh person to land the WFBB-sponsored Woody Woodpecker balloon in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. (Mr. Pitt hears this and is intrigued; mouths the words Woody Woodpecker.) There are only three spots left. Were going to take a little break now; when we come back youll have three more chances to win a spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker. Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you? Mr. Pitt why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon? My father was a stern man. He forbad us to participate in any activities that he thought were associated with the common man. The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list. Oh. Alright Ill do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.) Alright here we go for the next spot under the balloon. If you know the name of this song call 555-BAND. (The music starts. Elaine listens intently.) Well Elaine? Do you know it? What song is it? Will you shut up? I cant hear! Im sorry! Oh! Ive got it! Its Next Stop Pottersville! (Grabs the phone to call it in.) Goody! Yes! Yes! Yes! (Dances back and forth elated) Next Stop Pottersville Next Stop Pottersville! You are a genius! You are gonna love this car. Even if you dont like Jon Voight. I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kindve a strange reason to buy a car because he might have driven it. What do you mean might? You dont think he really owned this car? I dont know. Well why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick why settle on Jon Voight? Dont you see thats the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson youd know hes making it up. Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry were talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck Oskar Schindlers a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry Jerrys about to get in.) Oh look at this I stepped in gum. Whoa whoa youre not getting in my car with gummy shoes. Alright Ill change my shoes. (Heads back to his apartment. George follows.) Liam Neeson. You know hes not American. Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.) Everybodys talkin at me...I cant hear a word theyre sayin...just drivin around in Jon Voights car... Kramer! (We hear Kramers door slam open and shut. Kramer enters. Jerry comes out of his room.) Hey! Wheres all my sneakers? You said take em. Not all of em! Well obviously there was a miscommunication. Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear? Jerry I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerrys room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) Cmon. There put on those boots. I cant wear these! Well why not? Theyre uncomfortable. Cmon here try em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.) Where did you get those? I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldnt afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh I cant wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous! Ah you look like a cowboy! Huh? But I dont wanna be a cowboy! Oh stop it. You know that friend of yours Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party. Yeah I got one too. Yeah? Oh yeah? Huh. What? No nothing. No what is it? No its just that I uh...didnt get one. You didnt get one? Ah but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaines addresses Im sure that means Im invited. Not necessarily. Hey why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if youre not invited to the party? Thats the genius of it. Im callin Elaine. See if she can find out anything from Tim Whatley. Hey. I got Jon Voights LeBaron. (Jingles the keys.) Boss! Four thousand dollars? We cant afford that! Well Im afraid youre gonna have to do something about it because its in violation of the building code. Otherwise theyre gonna close you up. But what if we cant pay for it? Then I have to report you. Otherwise I lose my license. Sorry. (Exits.) 48 years Mom! And now we have to close! All because of that idiot and his bloody nose! (Kramer enters.) Afternoon Mom! Afternoon Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now you oughta get that fixed. So? Cmon put the top up its November! I feel alive Jerry. Lets check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil. Hey...you dont think...sure thats Jon Voights pencil! With Jon Voights teeth marks. (Looks at the owners manual.) Owners manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight. Ah! See? I told ya. Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N. So? Doesnt Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N? So what are you saying? Nothing. Im sure Jon probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.) Get out of the car! What? Thats right you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me! Oh look! Theres Gregory Pecks bicycle! Get out! And Barbara Mandrells skateboard! Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.) Hey cowboy. Wheres your horse? (Jerry slips and slides in his cowboy boots and runs away.) Yeah you better run! Did they take anything? No they didnt even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots. Anyway again Im sorry about throwing you out of the car. You really seemed to enjoy it. It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know maybe his name really is J-O-H-N but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well you know J-O-N is a lot zippier. Yeah thats possible. How would you find out something like that...wait a minute what am I thinking? Ive got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal. Hell dispose of it. Heh thats right. See ya later. (Exits.) So Jerome I did a little snooping around for you. Ah! Whatd you find out Lois? Well I talked to Tim Whatley... Yeah... And I asked him Should Jerry bring anything? So...? Mmmm...and he said Why would Jerry bring anything? Alright but let me ask you this question. What? Which word did he emphasize? Did he say Why would Jerry bring anything? or Why would Jerry bring anything? You emphasize Jerry or bring. I think he emphasized would. You know what? The hell with this party I dont even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.) Hey. Hey so wheres my sneakers? Thats what I wanna know. What do you mean? Well I saw Mom and Pop this morning but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished. So all my sneakers are gone? Im afraid so. And thats just the tip of the iceberg. Ive been asking around - they didnt even have any kids. Mom and Pop arent even a Mom and Pop?! It was all an act Jerry. They conned us and they scored big time. So. Mom and Pops plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then run off with Jerrys sneakers. Apparently. Alright thats enough of this. Where ya goin? I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitts security pass for the parade. Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade? He finds his laugh intoxicating. (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker and exits.) So George what kind of promotional events are we talking about? Well I think we need more special days at the stadium you know? Like uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or uh...Jon Voight Day. Jon Voight? The actor? (Rubs his eyes wearily.) Uh I make a motion that we have no more of these meetings that have been initiated by George Costanza. I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day youd all be patting me on the back. I guessed Stan Hermans Boomtown Blues. Whatd you guess? Um it was uh...Next Stop Pottersville. (The group is unimpressed.) Uh do you know when theyre giving out the passes? After the music. (The band starts playing directly behind Elaine. She is deafened by the loudness of the horns.) Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.) Taxi! (Walks right by Kramer.) Taxi. Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey listen can I ask you something? Listen listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively Voight grabs Kramers arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street stunned.) No Jon Voight Day huh? No. Now Ill always have this doubt about the car. What your jaw still hurts? Yeah its all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday. You should have somebody take a look at that. Im calling dentists all day here theres nobody working the day before Thanksgiving. You going to the party? No I dont know if Im invited. Well theres going to be a lot of dentists there. Yeah youre right. You dont want to suffer with this all weekend. Yeah I gotta see a dentist this is killin me. Well Ill take a chance. Well go together. Maybe Ill just meet you there. You dont want to go with me? Jerry for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited unwelcome intruder? The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey sod you find my sneakers yet? No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in a Mr. Jon Voight the actor? Jon Voight! Are you kiddin me? Did you talk to him? Well he was a little standoffish. What you didnt ask him about the car? No I couldnt his cab pulled away. But he did however make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look. What? His tooth marks. He bit me. Jon Voight bit you? Well what is he a vampire? No its justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet. He left perfect imprints. That he did. Now you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match em up and well see whether or not youre driving Jon Voights car! Oh please. Wait a minute wait its not that stupid. No its stupid. Why? Why isnt it possible? I mean theyre both bite marks. So youre gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramers gnarled arm. Its worth a shot. (Goes to the door.) So Kramer you wanna go to the party together? Jerry look come on Im an invited guest. I cant be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher. Excuse me uh...dentist? You a dentist? (The guy shakes his head. Jerry moves on to another guy.) Dentist? Are you a dentist? These are the balloons? Big deal all I see is Woody Woodpecker. You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker? Yeah what is he? Some sort of an instigator? Thats right. Hes a troublemaker. Hey Elaine. Did you get my message? What? I cant hear a word youre saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Wheres Tim? What is that the Empire State Building? What? I cant hear you. Elaine would you marry me? I told you I cant hear a word. Alright. Forget it. Hey Tim. Hey George. Kramer how ya doin. (They shake hands.) Watch the arm! Tim listen we dont want to bother you we know youre busy here. No its no problem what is it? Let me show you something take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.) Alright Tim Im gonna get goin. Alright let me take down your number. (Grabs Georges pencil then notices Jerry sitting on the couch.) Is that Jerry Seinfeld? He didnt come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.) Uh Tim the pencil... Jerry. Hey Tim. Jerry. I didnt think youd show. Did you say Jerry I didnt think youd show or Jerry I didnt think youd show? (Elaine comes over.) Elaine! Hi! Tim. Well. Im really glad you came. What? Really glad you came. Uh huh. Listen Elaine Ive been wanting to ask you...would you like to go out with me New Years Eve? (Elaine thinks Tim is offering her a nut and shakes her head no. Tim rejected walks away.) Thanks. What? What? Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someones arm matched teeth marks on a pencil? Its possible. Roll up your sleeve. Somebody bit you? Not just someone. Jon Voight. Jon Voight bit you? (George notices Tim across the room with the pencil in his mouth.) The pencil! Hey hey! Get the pencil out of your mouth youre destroying Jon Voights teeth marks! Thats John Voights pencil? Thats right. I got his whole car downstairs. Are you the one who bought his LeBaron convertible? Yes! Yes Im the one! Hey! So you know Jon Voight! Yes! Yes I went to dental school with him. Jon Voight the actor? No. The periodontist. (George snaps the pencil in two.) Cant this wait until Monday? Come by my office. Just a quick peek. Im in agony. Alright. Sit down. Its this one here in the back. (Tilts his head back and knocks Elaines trophy out the window. A loud hissing sound and commotion is heard from the street below. Everyone runs to the windows to look.) Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker! Hey who invited you anyway? Youre a troublemaker! (Jerry nervously laughs like Woody Woodpecker as the breeze from the popped balloon blows in the window.) Hey it looks like Woody Woodpecker is running out of air. In fact hes collapsing. Those kids look pretty disappointed. Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello? Hello is this Jerry Seinfeld? Yes it is. You dont know me but a really strange thing happened. I was at a garage sale and this old couple sold me a used pair of sneakers they claimed belonged to Jerry Seinfeld the comedian. Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop theyre sellin my sneakers! Where are they? Parsippany New Jersey. Lets go! My cars in the shop. Well how are we getting to Parsippany? Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again. Maybe we should get you to a hospital. Hey I aint goin to no Bellevue! Look at me Im fallin apart here.]
93,6,9,[Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview. Thats incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother. Yeah and now someones going to be taking messages for me. From your mother. So this ah woman you plan on hiring is she going to be in the Spokes model category? Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh Ive given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability. Thats a 180 George. Whatever. Hi Willie. Hey Jerry. nan I got this stuff and ah my mothers fur coat for storage. What are you doing with it? Ah she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida. Hi. Hi. Hey Jerry you know my wife Donna. Yeah thats why I said hi. Hey nice jacket. (looking over the jacket) Thanks. Its Hounds-Tooth. Whoa this is a beauty. Great cut. Its probably very flattering. Oh yes it really accentuates my bust line. Well I type about 90 words a minute. Im completely well-versed in all IBM and Macintosh programs. (looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins youre ah obviously qualified for the job. Youve all the necessary skills and experience. But youre extremely attractive. youre gorgeous. Im looking at you I cant even remember my name. So ah Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in. Youre luscious. Youre ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in) As you can see my references are impeccable. I think Id be a real asset here. My only concern is I do take care of my mother. So will there be any late nights? I cant imagine. Ok So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldnt take my eyes off myself. Yeah. OK so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins. So youre saying Store -- Hotsy-Totsy Home-- Hotsy-Notsy. Yeah exactly. Anyway Ive got to go over there and return it. I thought we were going to the movies? All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes) Hey hey. Hey George Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I dont know why I didnt have one before. Because you didnt have a job? Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in everything is organized -- messages appointments. And I cant tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade. A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit. Its a little ... All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there. You got no waist in that thing. You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli. I said All Right. Well whad you buy it for? Why did I buy it because in the mirror at Barneys I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the i sounds like an e) Moore in Indecent Proposal. How fast was she walking? Demi (the i sounds like an e)? I thought it was Demi? No. I think its Demi. (the i sounds like an e) Really? I never heard of a semi (the i sounds like an e) tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement) Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know whats going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise) What? Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors they make you look like 10 pounds lighter. Oh youre crazy. Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys? (to Jerry as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there. Whoa. What are you all dressed up for? Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys. Good idea. Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies. Yeah yeah ok. Hey look if youre going there maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating its a total-protection moisturizer with Uva. Moisturizer? Thats girls stuff. No no look. Ill tell you what -- theyre having a sale right. yeah. Ill meetcha down there well have lunch. Well we could ... Well well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief) And then assuming the strike is resolved on April 14th we ah play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel. Anaheim Hotel. (George picks up a container of chinese food from the credenza) You may want to reconsider. I believe they only have room service until 10 P.M. and then its only finger foods. Ade youre a wonder. (he he -- george laughs) OK now I projected some of those figures for you regarding the switch to Canola oil for the stadium popcorn and surprisingly it will only come to 1/2 a cent more per bag so it is definitely doable. Ade I have to tell you I I have never met anybody so ... efficient. Well thank you Im flattered. I mean youre just youre just a marvel of organization. Well Im just hm doing my job. Its like Im thinking of something and youre (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me. What can I say? Im ... Im good at what I do. (smiling and quietly laughing proudly) (coyly he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now? (thinking about the question she stops writing) Yes I think I do. (she turns her head slowly and looks directly at him) Is it uh doable? Its definitely doable. Well that was the worst. I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break. (waiting in line for tickets he overhears Elaine) Hey give us a break. We havent seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth! You got a pen? Yeah I think I do. And I need something to write on. Well all I got is my dry-cleaning stub. I gust met Uma Therman. Shes giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry Uma. Uma Therman? Really? Yeah. Howd you manage that. Yeah well I dont have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater) Hes got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey isnt that Willie my dry-cleaner? Where? He just went in. You know I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket. What would he be doing wearing your jacket? It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it. Are you sure? I got it. Uma Uma Uma. (looking at the ticket) You are amazing. Yeah all right. Taxis on me. (he walks off camera) Ah no no no no no. A better way to reach the bra would be to undo the jacket then go around the back of the shirt. Ade you are incredible Oh ...oh ...oh ... Here I want to show you something. Hand me that pillow. What? Oh My God! Mr. CO STAN ZA! Ade ahh ahh ah ... Im giving you a raise! So youre having sex and then all of a sudden you just blurt out Im giving you a raise. Yeah. Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises? Not that Im aware of no. So youre so grateful to have sex that youll just shout out anything that comes into your head. I didnt think ahead. Well maybe shell just think it was bawdy talk. I didnt say any other bawdy things. Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back. All right you know youre not any help at all here. I dont know what even the point is of talking to you anymore. All right all right. Im sorry. Yeah well I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise. How long has she been there? 3 days. Its almost a week. Oh My god. What? Its a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes. These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think that the department of ... you know whatever would be very interested to know whats going on here. Well were more than happy to exchange it for something else. OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator) Ill bring it to your dressing room. Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for? Well Elaine when youre shopping on Madison Avenue you dont want to skip on the swank. I like your little bag. Huh oh hey look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) Its the super hydrating triple-action moisturizer hmm. Huh. Wait till that Uma smells this Uva. Hey Kramer. Hey Bania whats happening? (Kramer looking into the mirror is putting moisturizer under his eyes) Im looking for a new suit. I cant find anything I like. Thats a nice suit. (admiring Kramers suit) Well thank you. Did you get that here? No this is vintage. They dont make this stuff anymore. Youre telling me. I sure am. Its hard for me to find pants that -- (interrupting Bania) That dont make you look high-waisted. Yes Me too. What size are you? Uh 42. 42 Thats what I am now. Ive been working out Im huge. Howd you like to sell it? make me an offer. 100 Bucks Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania) 175 Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship. 300 dollars. Sold. Follow me into the dressing room. You throw the shirt in? Bania youre killing me. Hey thats the womens dressing room. Theres nothing in there that I havent seen before. (Opens the door looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner (waves) can I talk to you for a second? Yes yes George. Can you talk to me for a second? Of course you can -- Im a very accessible man. I just wanted to say youre doing great work on that Canola oil stuff. Well you know to be honest sir -- my my new secretary Ade came up with that one. Ade Ade I like that name George. She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room) Is that a fact George? Yes In fact her mother is in the hospital right now. Its some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk) I had a bout of that myself one time -- knocked me right on my ass. She cant even afford to go out to lunch. Shes been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. Its pathetic. Whats that cost her like two and a quarter? ($2.25) You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise. You know shed be better off making a sandwich at home and bringing it in. (picks up the telephone hand set) Hello ah George will you excuse me. Psst. Hey. Kramer what are you doing here? Listen I need you to get me some clothes. What? Yeah I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred. So go buy a new one. What at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin. So. Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry tell him to bring me some clothes. Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door) Hello Willie. Hey Jerry. You dropping off? No but ah seen any good movies lately? You came by to ask that? Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon Willie? What are you gettin at? I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket. Jerry thats a breach of the dry-cleaners code. You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes I wasnt wearing your jacket. Jerry youre imagining things. (he makes the circular motion next to his ears - the international symbol for insane) Yeahhh am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter) Jerry. Yeah Yeah. Well now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mothers fur coat back too. Jerry come on. Now. Now? (Willie looks off with his eyes to his left -- he is thinking about his wife Donna) Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet looking for the dry-cleaning ticket) Well ... ahh. (apprehensively) Wheres that ticket? Oh Kramer. Wait you you mean to tell me you dont have a ticket for the coat? No not on me. Well I I need to see that ticket. Why? Ive got my cleaning before without a ticket. Yeah but this is different. Those fur storage warehouses are huge. You cant get anything without a number. All right Ill be back. Yeah it looks good here but what does that mean? So uh do you want it? I dont know I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror. I cant thank you enough Mr. Costanza. Im so grateful Yes well I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise and if you didnt get it that I was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right) It was just so generous. Oh well dont worry about it -- hes got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her) Oh I know but Twenty Five Thousand. (spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25000 a year raise. Yes I tell you Mr. Steinbrenner... Youre making more than I am. I am? What are you doing? Youre making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss. Well apparently they can. Oh this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large) Hey what do you think of this? (with disbelief): Youll never pull it off. Hey whats going on in there? (to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me could you tell me where I could find like womens moisturizer lotions? This woman has been in there for over an hour. Excuse me Miss. Is everything ok in there? [Yeah] (through the door) Kramer? Oh Jerry you got my clothes? What clothes? Didnt Elaine call you? No. Well what are you doing here? What am I doing here? Youre in the womens dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mothers fur coat out. Oh the stub yeah. I left it in my my pants Where are your pants? Well I sold them to Bania. What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in. Whyd you sell your pants to Bania? ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number. Where are your clothes? I told you I sold them to Bania. You mean what you were wearing? Yeah. Howd you expect to get out of here? Well I didnt think ahead. This isnt going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else. No. No? No because youre taking that one. I am? Yes. Because you wore it out of the store. Ha! Thats preposterous. I suppose that salt stain came from all the snow in the store. Shall I wrap it or will you wear it out? No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer are you still in there? [Elaine] Jerry? Elaine wheres Kramer? Bania? Kramer. Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room while Kramer remains inside) Jerry. Bania. Kramer I want my money back for this suit. Youre nancy-boy cream leaked all over the pockets -- Suits ruined. Well youre not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry come back in here. (to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room) Umas number is on that ticket. Never mind Uma I need that ticket to get my mothers fur coat back. Why dont you just give him the money for the suit? Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it. I got an idea. What? I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania) Bania can I talk to you for a second? Hows everything going? Pretty good. Yeah well see the thing of it is Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because uhh I dont want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket thats in the pocket of those pants. Well all you gotta do is tell Kramer to give me my money back and youll get your ticket. Yeah yeah all right well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket and uh I will take you out for a nice dinner. Can we go back to Mendys? You want to go to Mendys Ill take you to Mendys. Twice? I wanna go twice. all right lets be reasonable Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think its a pretty good deal. Two Mendys. . . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket. Here you go. Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room) But Mr. Steinbrenner how can I be expected to perform my job properly knowing that my uh subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir its outta whack. Uh huh I understand what youre saying George and I know what its like to be financially strapped. When I was a young man in Cleveland I use to hitchhike to work. One time I got picked up by a bakery truck. You think that stuff smells good? Try being cooped up in the back of one of those babies. I couldnt look at a donut for the next two years. Well not that I was ever one for the sweets. Sure I like a cup cake every now and then like everybody else. You know I like it when they have a little cream on the inside its a surprise. Thats good plus the chocolate ones are good too. Sometimes I just cant even make up my mind. A lot of times Ill mix the two together make a vanilla fudge. Let me in its me. (Kramer opens the door Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You dont know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket) (closes the door) All right nice work. (he looks at the ticket flips it over and then over again) Wheres Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number. (Takes the ticket back and looks at it flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too. (grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts. (grabs the ticket back) Give me that. Hey Bania the dinners off. The tickets no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania) (looking at the ticket then quickly looks up at Jerry) You trying to get out of Mendys? you cant do that. The ticket is worthless. You promised me. Hey Isnt that my mothers fur coat? No its not. (the coat) It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back. No what are you talking about. Are you out of your mind? Dont you ... take your hands ... You cant have that coat its not yours. What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet! Donna do you think you can get the salt stain out of this? Let me see. (Looking at the stain) Piece of cake. Bring it (Tilts her head down looking over her glasses in amazement of Mmm. This soup is great. Yeah its very good. (reluctantly) I told you Mendys had the best pea soup. The best Jerry the best. Are you enjoying it? Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (its obvious he isnt) Wait till you try the swordfish. You know Jerry I was thinking. For our next meal do you think we should come here ... or should we go someplace else? You know it has its pros and cons. On the one hand here youre guaranteed a great meal. On the other hand -- (Interrupting Bania) Yeah yeah I know. This would be good but it would be the same. But if we go some place else it would be different but it might not be as good. Its a gamble. I get it. Yeah. Well lets hurry up and eat I gotta get out of here. Im meeting a woman for a drink. Oh and who might that be? Some woman named Uma. I got her number off of that ticket before it was smudged. Hope shes good-looking. (crosses his fingers in the air) If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant Im telling you right now I dont want to hear about the specials. I dont want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is if the specials were so special theyd be on the menu. You know whats special about them? They dont know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too you know. The veil is lightly slapped and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.]
94,6,10,[Ready to go Lois? You really like to say my name? Dont you? Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmys in trouble Lois. Oh Mr. Meyers this is my friend Jerry. Jerry Seinfeld! Duncan Meyers! You two know each other? Yeah! We uh went to High School together. Didnt we Jerry? Gee I hope youre not leaving now. We still have a lot of work left to do. Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush hour to pick me up? Well Id have to be Superman to do that Lois. No no This is all wrong. Wheres the Chicken Cashew? You no order Chicken Cashew. I didnt order any of this. Im not paying for this. Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list. What list? The do not deliver list. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well I guess well just go out. Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker? Ned must have left it here. Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist? HE reads everything you know Neds very well read. Maybe hes just very well RED? Communist? Dont you think he probably would have told me? Well does he wear bland drab olive colored clothing? Yes . . . yes he does dress a little drab. Huh hes a communist. . . . Look at this. Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important. . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace. Hi oh. Hey. Wheres Lois? She couldnt make it. I cant believe youre really going out with a woman named Lois. I know finally. But George guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers. Duncan Meyers? Whos he? Elaine only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and thats George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet. Uh uh I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua the gym . . . Whats that? Mr. Bevilacqua the gym teacher. Oh of course. He was down at the other end. So he yells out Ready On your mark Get set  and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody. No. I looked up. I couldnt believe it. By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start. Really? And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. Hes hated me ever since. Now hes back. Well what happened when you raced him again? I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run. So now Duncan is back? Hes back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man thats some tart cider! Hi. Sorry I missed the Chinese food. Oh so am I . Uh hows Duncan? Hes okay. He say anything? About what? Oh nothing in particular. . . . Why did you cheat in that race? I did not cheat. He said that you got a head start. Oh hes just jealous because he came in second. Really? Yes So you WERE the fastest kid in school. Faster than a speeding bullet Lois. So how was work? Another day another dollar? I guess. Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist? Yes as a matter of fact I am. OH AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE!

Well you had a good run what was it 75 80 years? Wreaking havoc making everybody nervous. Yeah we had a good run. Well so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha So you lied to her? I couldnt tell her the truth. I dont know whats going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. Shell go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that Well Im dating a communist. Wow a communist. Thats something. Yeah thats pretty cool isnt it? Hey did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker? The Daily Worker has personal ads? And they say appearance is not important. Yours or hers?

Kramer Ive got some literature in my car that will change your whole way of thinking. Talk to me baby. Dont listen to him Kramer youve got a good job here. But theres no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already beaten you in Junior High School three times. I didnt hit puberty til the 9th grade. Thats what gave me my speed. Besides if I got a head start why didnt Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race? Thats what Ive always wondered about. Well I . . . [sees George] Oh my God No oh my God . . . Jerry!

Yeah yeah It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now. Yeah yeah Well you really got bald there didnt you? Yeah yeah. You really used to have a think full head of hair. Yeah yeah. Well I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one. yeah yeah. What do you do? Im an architect. Have you designed any buildings in New York? Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim? You did that? Yep. And it didnt take very long either. Well youve really built yourself up into something. Well well I had a dream Jerry. Well one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this. Well I like to stay in touch with the people. Ah you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas? You know my drivers waiting I really should get running. Good to see you guys again. George George hang on. I havent seen you in so long. Ha uh I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race. Oh the big race. Yeah. Yes yes. You were there? Yes sure surely was. Yeah Ill remember that day. Well Ill never forget it because that was the day that I uh lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford the uh voluptuous home room teacher. Miss Stafford? Yes yes you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . . George! But I digress. Let me see now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like the first five yards and then  BOOM...You were gone. Did I get a head start? Head start oh no absolutely not. You satisfied? So you see? No Im still not convinced and I never will be. Thats a good idea. No no no another race - out of the question. I know youve been saying that for twenty years because you know you cant beat me. You couldnt beat me then and you cant beat me now. Race him Jerry. Race him. All right! Ill do it. The race is on. . . . shut up! (?) And hes calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I cant do it. I cant go through with it. Im calling it off. I cant let the legend die. Its like a kid finding out theres no Santa Claus Each according to his ability to each according to his needs. What does that mean? Well if youve got needs and abilities thats a pretty good combination. So what if I want to open up a delicatessen? There are no delicatessens under Communism. Why not? Well because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. Thats not right. So you cant get Corned Beef? Well you know if youre in the Politburo maybe. (on phone) . Its George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? Im not a Communist . . . . All right all right. All right Ill be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada told Mr Steinbrenner Im a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office. So youll just explain to him youre not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date. Hello oh hi Duncan 4:00 oclock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? Ill tell you why. Because I chose not to run! Im sorry Elaine. The shirts too fancy. Just because youre a communist does that mean you cant wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. Its gorgeous. Fine you want to be a Communist be a Communist. Cant you at least look like a successful Communist? All right Ill try it on. Im going to order Chinese Food. Youre ordering from Hop Sings right? Ugh does it have to be Hop Sings. I kind of had a fight with him. Elaine when my father was black listed he couldnt work for years. He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sings every day figuring out how to survive. Youre father was blacklisted? Yes he was and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people he trusted. They named names. Okay okay. (phones) Um yeah hi Id like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G. I know that address. Youre Benes right. Youre on our list. No more delivery. No. no she doesnt live here anymore. This is someone else. Oh yeah. Whats the name? Why do you need the name? You already have the address. We need a name. Give us a name. Okay okay Ned Isakoff. I want a racing car set. Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs they sell it at triple the cost. But I want a racing car set. You see kid youre being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys. Hey this guys a COMMIE! Hey kid quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such a bad word like that? Huh? Commie Commie Commie . . . (unknown) . Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didnt he Santa! Is there a problem here? ho ho ho ho. This guys a Commie. Hes spreading propoganda. Oh yeah? Well thats enough pinko! Youre through. The both of ya I got two kids in college. You cant fire me Im Santa Claus. Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here. Hi how are you? . . . Fine. Whats the matter? I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you dont race hes going to fire me. What? He cant do that. Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going to do Jerry? Dont worry Lois. Ill think of something. Ah I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff. You got me blacklisted from Hop Sings? She named name! You uh wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner? Yes George I did. Come in come in. George the wordaround the office is that youre a Communist. C-Communist? I am a Yankee sir first and foremost. You know George it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest thing ever to happen to this organization. Sir? You could be invaluable to this franchise. George theres a southpaw down there nobodys been able to get a look at; something Rodriguez I dont really know his name. You get yourselfdown to Havana right away. Yes sir. Yes sir do my best. Good Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of those cigars in the cedar boxes you know the ones with the fancy rings? I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while youre smoking. The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. The Maduro I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better thats what I say. Of course the Claros good too. Thats more of a pale brown almost like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. They have it in centimeters which I dont really understand that well... That was quick! Nice job Santa! Yeah I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble. Yeah well I didnt realize that was such a sensitive issue. Communism You didnt realize Communism was a sensitive issue? What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? Wake up and smell the coffee. I guess I screwed up! You sure did. Big time. How do you feel? I need a miracle. Now youre going to see what kind of liar youre mixed up with. If he beats you I want a big raise. If he beats me Ill not only give you a raise Ill send you to Hawaii for two weeks. I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport. Okay all right all right. You ready boys? Yes Mr. Beviacqua Okay this is hoiw it works. You take your marks I say READY - ON YOUR MARK - GET SET - and then fire. You got it? Yes Mr. Bevilacqua. READY - ON YOUR MARK Maybe I will  Lois. Maybe I will. You wanted to see me El Presidente? Si si. (a Spanish word I cant figure out) Come here. I understand you are very interested in one of our players eh? Si si. Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but Ive heard you are uh how you say Communista simpatico eh? Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy. Well good then you can have your pick. Oh oh! They will play for your Yankees. Oh well gracias El Commandante gracias. Muy muy. And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and I hear some pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably have to eat standing up which I dont care for but on the other hand I dont like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party I put my plate on someones piano. I assure you if I had not been a dictator I would not have been able to get away with that one.]
95,6,11,[Come on. Lets go No wait I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitts tennis recquet. Whats it doin here? He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up Hello Oh Hi. Jocylin Landis from Doubleday. I interviewed you for a position a couple of months ago. Yes yes the one I didnt get. (they giggle) I was watching you play Oh Im not very good.

Um I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow. Thats so generous of you. Thanks You loaned her Pitts racquet? What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldnt that be great I wouldnt have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore. I gotta get going. Oh OK. Next time lets play ping pong. Its easier to jump over the net.

George youre becoming one of the gliterratti Whats that. Ya know people who glitter. Shes a slim gal. And the amazing thing is she eats like theres no tomorra. I mean Ive never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I dont know how she does it. Maybe shes bulimic Wa? Bulimic Kramer shes a model. Exactly I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating. There you go monkey boy. Mmm Mmmm oh so good mmm mmm. Arent you hungry? Just enjoying watching you. So did you like the movie? Yeah it was OK. Frankenstein didnt seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket. (nods silently) Not that it was that nice of a jacket.

Every time we go out to eat the minute we were done eating shes runnin to the bathroom. So youre concerned. Elaine of course Im concerned. Im payin for those meals. Its like throwing money down the toilet. In a manner of speaking. Let me digest it. Let me get my moneys worth. Yknow what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me. Heres your scrubber back. Thanks. Hey maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room. A matron? Yeah uh well I cant help you there (weakly). Wha? Nothin You know a matron? Me?

I cant I cant Kramer youre going to have to face her some time (mumbles) bd bd Hello (sees Landis) Oh my goodness. What happened? I tore my umeral epicondilitist Oh My doctor said it might never fully heal. I may never play again. Oh youll be playing ... If I cant play tennis I dont know what Ill do. There are plenty of things you can do theres chess and uh uh mah jong You dont know how lucky you are to be healthy ... ... and biking and .. What am I going to do? ... hiking ... (wimpers) (sees racquet) Could I ... If I cant play tennis I have no reason to live .. (cries) (sees racquet) You know its not important Im gonna ok well you know. Take care of that condolitis Ma? Cosmo! Cosmo? Why didnt you just ask her for it? I told you I couldnt. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again Yeah Hey di ho Cmon up. So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt? augh hes got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy? Hell only play with his racquet Well why dont you wait til shes not there on her lunch hour and just take it? Thats stealing? Stealing? You loaned her the racquet! I know. Hey oh. JERRY: Hey So what happened with Kramers mother? Its all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works. Whats she like? Oh shes a Kramer. And uh while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend. Ah Im ready what? What is it? I uh got the first name. You found out Kramers first name? Thats right. You ready? Weve been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it? Cosmo JERRY: Cosmo? Cosmo JERRY: Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo? Whats so funny? ... wha? COSMO? All right OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag. Its not such a bad name. Well you know all my life Ive been running away from that name. Thats why I wouldnt tell anybody. But Ive been thinking about it. All this time Im trying not to be me. Im afraid to face who I was. But Im Cosmo Jerry. Im Cosmo Kramer. And thats who Im going to be. From now on thats who Im going to be. Im Cosmo! Yes? Hi is Sandy here? Hi you must be Jerry. Sandys in the shower. Do you want to come in? I would except I forgot to bring a towel. (laughs nicely) So the roommate laughed at everything I said. Wow. It was a great sounding laugh too kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse has. You know those? Oh yeah: HA-A-A HA-A-A. Yeah. Hate the big coarse ha. Hate those. And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man. I see. So as you can see Ive got a bit of a problem here. Well if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal pay your check leave here and never mention this to anyone again. Cant be done huh? The Switch? The Switch. Cant be done. I wonder. Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it! They didnt have roommates in the Middle Ages. Well Im sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together. The point is I intend to undertake this. And Ill do it with or without you. So if youre scared if you havent got the stomach for this lets get it out right now! And Ill go on my own. If not you can get on board and we can get to work! Now whats it going to be? All right dammit Im in. I couldnt do it without you. All right. Lets get to work. All right. Thats enough for today. Youre tired. Get some sleep. Ill see you first thing in the morning. Aw we cant do it who are we kidding? Its impossible! Its true! You cant do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Lets face it. Im stuck with the non-laugher and thats that! Well come up with something. Yeah sure we will. All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs exits.) I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!! All right. Lets go over it again one more time. All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with her and her roommate. Thats right. And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises. Keep going. At this point it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events. Continue. The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request. A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor which she [Laura] of course cannot resist an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered. Huh. Well it all sounds pretty good. Theres only one flaw in it: Theyre roommates. Shed have to go out with me behind Sandys back. Shes not gonna do that. You disappoint me my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura If you want to waste your time with that pervert thats your problem. Its a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple. (George finger in the peanut butter jar): This is what I do. Can I help you? Uh no Im OK. Well then what are you doing with that racquet? Um its mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it. Well Im sorry you cant take that no no no.. No no no I can. I can. Its mine. Its my racquet. Look sweetheart I dont know who you are. I dont know what youre doing here. But... All right. Im going Im going Not with ... Give it give it .. Leave ... All right all right forget it. You dont have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you? I dont have to but I will. Morning Cosmo Hi Mr. Clotworthy How are you today? Ah couldnt be better. Hi Lorraine. Hi Cosmo My mom Babs. Hi Mrs. Kramer Lorraine Yes Its a fine day (Larry Davids voice) What do you say Cosmo? Hey everything my man. What: You know I dont know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois. Oooo that is a wild idea Uh? You ma know Ive been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job. Yes well isnt that just easy for you to say. What the hell do you think Im going to do with myself? Well maybe we could go into business together. If youre clean? Ive been clean for two years. Anyway what would we do together? Ive got plenty of ideas. Ive always believed in you Cosmo. You know that. So I want you to call that place today and tell then tha youre through. All right. Ill do it. Mmmm mm so good. ... so glad. Will you excuse me Ive got to freshen up. And why shouldnt you? Be fresh Stay fresh Ill be back. Im not feeling very well. Care to see our dessert menu? Uh yeah. Do you know Babs? Oh yeah I was sorry to hear she left. Babs left? She quit today. Ah Ha.

Who sent you that one? One Tim Whatley! Not my Tim Whatley? The same he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets. I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. Hes a regifter! Or maybe he liked your gift so much he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps its an homage. Yeah perhaps. Well how did he react when you gave it to him? Um he said Oh. A label maker. Howbout that? He repeated the name of the gift? Yeah so? Oh well if you repeat the name of the gift you cant possibly like it. What do you mean? Oh you know like when someone opens something up and they go Oh. Tube socks.  What are you gonna do about it? I dont know I guess Ill just get invited up to his apartment and see if hes got a label maker. Whyd you get him a gift anyway? Oh he did some dental work for me and he didnt charge me so I thought Id get him a Christmas present. Yeah well if youre getting him anything for his birthday Im alarge. Well here we are. This is the place. Wow. Do you like it? I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch is this velvet?! Are you a velvet fan? A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.

Hes a great guy youll really like him. Im sure I will. Male roommate huh? Yes. A male roommate. Is this a problem? Its a huge problem Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! Hes already got that. Well maybe hes -- No. Believe me hes not. So hes an eligible receiver. Shes confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! Its just a matter of time till they realize Hey we could have sex. Whats stopping them? Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage. What does he look like? Oh thats the worst part of it. He looks just like me. He looks like you and hes working from the inside? I look like me and Im working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position? Not you. Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end! Well take a check please. I gotta find a way to work this out I love that apartment. Its so cozy Im ensconced in velvet. You know if it were socially acceptable-- I know you would drape yourself in velvet. Ive said that before? Many times. You love velvet you want to live in velvet everything with the velvet. (entering)  Hey. Hey. Hey. Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super. So what? The super has keys to your apartment. Dont you see whats going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.

The little people; you and George. Are you through? Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah the Drakes wedding? Thats off. The wedding is off? What happened? The Drake he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it they got in a big argument and *phlf* its over. The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl. I cant call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back. You just gave them to him two days ago hes gotta give you a grace period. Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? Theres no grace period. Well didnt he regift the label maker? Possibly. Well if he can regift why cant you degift? You may have a point. I have a point I have a point. Alright Ill call him. Yeah. Whats that? Oh its Risk its a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials)  Hello Tim? Yeah hi its Jerry Seinfeld remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans he cant change them. (eating a pickle)  Well theyre his tickets he can do what he wants with them. Thanks. Alright I gotta go. Im heading over to Bonnies. What are you gonna do about the roommate? I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. Its like a Sigfried and Roy trick. Well the pickle breath is a good start. Hello Jerry may I come in? What do you want? (squeezing himself through the narrow space)  Nothing just being neighborly. Do you wanna hang out? Shoot the breeze? Im not letting you cheat Newman. Youre not getting anywhere near that board. Jerry? Im a little insulted. Youre not a little anything Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here. (leaving)  Oh by the way what are you doing for the Super Bowl? I dunno watch it on TV I guess. Why? Well if you watch closely enough you just might see me. Ill be the one waving to the camera from my seat on the forty yard line. Youre going to the Super Bowl? Yes I am a guy on my mail route just got a couple of tickets and he offered one to me. Whats his name? Tim Whatley. Thats my ticket! Is it?! Ohhh well if only youd known you could have saved some time and given it directly to me! Ha ha ha. (as Newman leaves)  Newman! What a movie. Good choice. Thank Scott. He recommended it. Oh Scott Scott. Hes really great isnt he? Yes he is. Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on do you cinch it real tight are you concerned about that? George? Do you hold the neck together with one hand or are you just letting it flap in the breeze? George youre being ridiculous. Whats the massage situation? What do you mean? Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing touching finger manipulation on the other person and if so whos making the request? George would you just stop? Say you go to the bathroom at two oclock in the morning whats the outfit? I mean you dressing up or is it come as you are? George what is wrong with you? Ill tell you whats wrong a grown woman with a male roommate! Its unnatural its an abomination! Hey! Hey! How ya going? Im good. (to Bonnie) Are you gonna need the bathroom? Cause Im gonna jump in the shower. No just throw my bras out of the way. Well this is my building. Yes it is. This was fun you know? Yeah. So Ill call. Arent you gonna invite me upstairs? Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs? I would love to go upstairs. Elaine you are something else. No one can ever put a label on you huh? Well see. Newman. Hes going with Newman. How does Tim Whatley even know Newman? Newmans his mailman. Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?! Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?! Well hes merry. He is merry Ill give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) Whats this plant for? I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate. Oh well the cactus will smooth things over. Hey guess what? Im going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley. What? We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket. What about the label maker? Ah well. Wait a minute thats my ticket! You didnt even want to go. It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment you know to look for the label maker. So how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom? No. Then howd you get up there? I said Do you wanna go upstairs? And theres you ticket. What? Thats why youre going to the Super Bowl. Why? You go out with a guy one time you ask him to go upstairs like youre Mae West? Of course hes gonna try and get you alone for the weekend. You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs he thinks hes going downtown? Obviously. Youre crazy. Well what happened when you got upstairs? As soon as we walked in he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didnt even get a chance to look for the label maker. Yeah well I dont trust this guy. I think he regifted he degifted and now hes using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Im watching your door. My door? Yeah from my peephole. Fisheye sees all. (still outside)  What was that? Newman! (fleeing to the bedroom)  Damn! (after entering)  The bedroom! I see you Newman! I see you! Im taking the Congo as a penalty! Ive got a confession to make. Oh? Whats that? Ive got Super Bowl fever. Oh yeah me too. So where are we staying? Oh the Ambassador. Oh. Big room? Its a regular room but its right downtown. Downtown? Right downtown. What do they have there a couple of beds? Why? You bringing someone else? No but dont you think there should be two beds? Theres two of us. Oh a cactus. They dont need any water so you dont have to keep taking them to the bathroom. Well look whos here. I asked Scott to move out. Oh. Oh! So she kicked him out of the apartment. Thats right. Its just me and her. Wow she rearranged her whole life for you. I guess she did. Hes gone now Im the man. Thats not a good role for you. No its not. You unwittingly made a major commitment. Thats a lot of pressure. Oh my god. You wanted to be ensconced in velvet youre buried. I had the perfect situation here he was shouldering half the load. He was shouldering. (walking towards the door)  I couldnt leave well enough alone?! Where are you going? I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping. Oh well here. Take Whatleys label maker I dont want to see it again. Thanks. (rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there aint nothing you can do about it. So too bad about that Super Bowl ticket eh Newman? Yeah. I just hope Tim Whatleys electric bills dont suddenly get lost in the mail or it could be lights out for him. (walking out)  Thanks for having me over guys. Alright Ill see you later. Hey Jerry? Ah Tim Whatley. Out scalping? Ah see now Ive been thinking a lot about what happened and I feel horrible. Listen I want to give you a ticket back. Are you serious what about Elaine? Oh Elaine. Yeah well things just didnt work out like I thought they would. Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck)  Hey isnt this Kramers car? (yelling up)  Hey Cosmo!! Theyre towing your car!! (running to the window)  What?! Not my car!! Hey!! Theyre towing my car!! What are you doing? Im taking the board with me. So I guess Ill see you at the game. Yeah see you there. Hi George. What what happened? Wheres wheres all the stuff? Its gone. It was all his. Is this a label maker? The table the stereo the VCR the velvet couch wheres the velvet? They were his. Besides we dont need any of those things. We have each other. Are you sure you know where the impound yard is? Oh stop stalling. Come on. I cant think theres all this noise. Or is it because Ive built a stronghold around Greenland? Ive driven you out of Western Europe and Ive left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation. Im not beaten yet. I still have armies in the Ukraine. Ha ha the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? Its a sitting duck. A road apple Newman. The Ukraine is weak. Its feeble. I think its time to put the hurt on the Ukraine. I come from Ukraine. You not say Ukraine weak. Yeah well were playing a game here pal. Ukraine is game to you?! Howbout I take your little board and smash it!! Hello Tim. (startled)  Elaine hi. Dont worry Tim. I didnt come by to yell at you I didnt come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back. But you gave it to me. But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over Whatley. Uh ok. You dont have the label maker do you? Uh no. I knew it! Youre a regifter! Oh yeah some gift. That thing didnt work at all. What? You put a label on something then ten minutes later it would peel right off. It was the worst gift I ever got. (visibly upset)  Well I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling you were so so gentle and so caring and so sensitive. Oh Elaine! H... G... F. Seat four. One two three... f-- Hello Newman. Hello Jerry. Tim couldnt make it hes in love. Isnt that wonderful? Oh its enchanting. Hi. Heres the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? Its like a four hour game. George Scotts gonna drop by. He said he never got his boxes. Ill get the towels. (internally)  How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza think! Here we are. Hey do you know Bonnie I just had a pretty wild idea. What is it? Well I uh Im not sure how you pronounce it or anything but I uh I believe its M&eacute;nage &agrave; Trois? What? Hi. Scott! Remember what we talked about the other day? George is into it. Oh really?! Great streak of luck Im having. First Kramer almost beat me at Risk but I narrowly escaped and then Tim Whatley gives me his Super Bowl ticket. Can you move over at all?! And then just as Im about to go these boxes show up at the post office with no labels. No labels Jerry. You know what that means? Freebies!! I got this great mini-TV and a VCR oh its unbelievable. An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?]
97,6,13,[Hey George. Gary? Well well well well. Where the hellve you been? Ive been leaving you phone messages for months. I know. Ive been pretty busy. Busy. Dont give me busy. Whos not busy? Im busy were all busy everybodys busy. All right tell me whats kept you so busy? Mostly chemotherapy. Kay Ill see you. (to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig! (at car) Hey! Hey! Hey!

(to George) Hey. (to George) Hey buddy. Hey uh... What? Kramer I I I uh I need to talk to Jerry privately. Oh. What about? Kramer... Aw come on George you can share it with me huh? Hey youre hurting me! You gonna share it with me next time huh? I swear I swear! Aw all right Im looking forward to it. Right I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer. Oh yeah I knew. You knew? How did you know? He told me a few months ago. Why did he tell you and not me? I dont know. How are you closer to him than me? So is he okay? Oh yeah hes fine fine. He was in bad shape for a while though. Huh really? How bad? Was he on his death bed? No he was on his regular bed. So why didnt you tell me? He swore me to secrecy. So? Its not like youre my wife. Well I still think you shoulda told me. Hey believe me you were better off not knowing. Its not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick. Well I wanna talk to him about this. Thats right you let him have it. Mmm-mm. Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness? Thats what Im saying. His illness is your business. If not mine whose? If not now when? Were you just talking about me? No an old friend of ours Gary. Oh the guy with cancer? (to Jerry yelling) You told her? Shes not your wife! If I told you you woulda given it away. You dont think I can keep a secret? No but he wouldve read your face. You dont trust my poker face? Do you ever win at poker? (shamefaced) No. Hey. (to Elaine) Oh I just saw your old boyfriend on TV. Egh Jake Jarmel? Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Whered he get those. Why? You dont wear glasses. I know I know. But I need a new look Im stagnating. I have to say as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. Thats like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in. Yeah Ive considered that. (to Elaine) Look how do I get in touch with this guy? Well hes having a two day book signing at Waldens. Ah. You know we had a really bad break-up. The Jujy Fruits? (upset) Yeah the Jujy Fruits. Okay K-Man enjoy the book. Okay thank you. Listen Jake uh where did you get those eyeglass frames? I cant tell you that. So you dont know where you got em? Yes I do. But I dont want anyone else to have them. Well thats peculiar. (leaves) Eh theres that woman that never talks to anybody. Really? Every day she comes in she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody. Oh I talked to Debby Bibelo. She said to say hi. (pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary I really have to say Im a little bit hurt that you didnt decide to confide in me. Well frankly you cant keep a secret. You know youd get two pair the whole table knows. Well I still think it was wrong. Right well Im sorry all right. I guess I was just thinking of myself. (well obviously) Yes. ...so I called the litterbug a pig not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman. Yeah? So why didnt you? Scared of being shot. Mr Kramer let me tell you a story. In nineteen-seventy-nine I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a Church zone. That fine was never paid and since then that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City. For sixteen years I pursued him only to see him give me the slip time and time again. I never got a clean look at his face but hes become my white whale. Mr Kramer that day was yesterday! But thanks to you I dont know if Ill ever get that chance again! I like that eye patch. (standing) All right Im gonna move my car my meters up. Cant park in this city. (standing) Hey George listen. You know that company I work for they own that parking lot around the corner. Wha thats a Kinney lot? Yeah and theres a space opening up and I could get it for you. You just have to pay the tax on it. Itd be like fifty a month. Fifty bucks a month thats incredible! Okay thanks. All right I got lunch all right. You still owe me a secret. All right listen. There is something I havent told you all right? Yeah? Yeah but uhm you cant tell Jerry. What do think I tell Jerry everything? Its not like hes my wife. Okay. Well the thing is Ive been living a lie. Just one? Im living like twenty. (chuckles) Whats yours? Well I (laughs) I never actually had cancer. (laughs) Ill see you. (leaves) So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses? (rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry who moves his legs) Yeah isnt that just like him? (she steps over Jerrys legs) You know he has to be the only one who has em. Yeah tell me about it soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway I told Jake that you said hi. What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi? Yeah. I cant believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi? I never heard her say hi. Well its uh common courtesy. No no. (stamps foot) Kramer you dont understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi then I lose the upper hand. Its like a game of tag. Where you going? Nowhere. Youre going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel arent you? So what if I do? (heads for the door) (to the exiting Elaine) Yeah well listen. If youre going there (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine! Hey. Howd it go with Gary? (shifty avoiding Jerrys eyes) Fine fine. (he removes his coat) (suspicious) Really? (shifty) Yeah. You look like somethings on your mind. No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table) So thats your poker face. My regular face. No it isnt. Ive seen your regular face. That is not it. What are you saying? All right George cmon what dyou got? (sits opposite George) I got nothing. What you got a pair of bullets? What you talking about? Two pair? Three of a kind? Will you stop it? Oh my God you got a flush! Youre holding a flush! I dont have a flush. A full house? You got a full house? Turn em over George I wanna see em. Come on Im calling! (thumps hand on table) What dyou got! (broken shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer! So you see Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi. Youre saying you didnt say hi. Thats what Im saying. So thats what you came down here to tell me? Correct. You never said hi? Correct. You still like me dont you? Correct. (catches herself) Whats that? Hey I have been trying to get this book signed all day. (takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you when I didnt even say hi to you? Elaine coming down here to say that you didnt say hi is more of a gesture than if you did say hi. Ah Jake... (realises his logic) I uh... The doctors thought he had cancer but the surgery revealed he never actually had it. So what was wrong with him? Nothing! So hes been lying to me for two months?! Thats right. What kind of person is this? Theres only one other person who might be able to do something like this and thats you. Well... I dont even think you could do it. Oh I could do it. Yeah I guess you could. (snorts) Cmon. Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men just to put his mind at ease? You did that? Yeah. Oh I cant wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone) Wait a minute wait a minute. You cant say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry) Why not? (puts down handset) Because hell know I told you. Besides hes giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing. So youre telling me because youre getting free parking I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didnt? Yeah. Well I dont like it. I dont like it one bit! And Im supposed to see him tomorrow. Yeah well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You cant start acting any differently. You have to be nice. Why didnt he tell me? Because you were being so nice. I dont think I can be that nice. (shouts) You be nice! Gary? What dyou think? Check it out. (he tries a number of expressions turning his head side to side to show off the hairpiece) Is that from my gift certificate? Yeah buddy. You really came through for me man. Youve been so nice. (shakes Jerry by the hand) (through gritted teeth) Yeah well Im glad you could take advantage. Hey you know what Im thinking of doing? Im getting rid of all my fillings cos that mercurys toxic. Hey let me see your fillings. I dont think so. Oh come on open up. Let me take a look. You be nice! Hes giving me a parking space (echoes) parking space... parking space... (peering in) Well what dyou know. Hey lookee there youre loaded. Okay. (shuts mouth) Hey look whos over there. Miss Cool-toes. Check this out Jack! (rises) (to Jerry) Hey buddy. Hey. Look at you. Wha... whats this? Its an eyepatch. You look like a pirate. I wanna be a pirate. (gesturing) This is Gary. (to Gary) How you doing? All right. Well I tell you theres only one problem. Cant see on your right side? No. Its uh (swaps patch to the other eye) its itchy Nice car. Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight. So what made you just call me out of the blue like that? Oh well uh. Gary told me you said hi. I didnt say hi. You didnt? Uh no. I told him to send you my regards. I didnt say hi. Regards? Yeah regards. Anyway I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didnt say hi but he didnt have to act so smug. Oh I hate smugness. Dont you hate smugness? (heavy accent) Smugness is not a good quality. (looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think hes wearing glasses that look just like Jakes. Pull over stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend. Good. Revenge is very good. (calling down street) Scuse me! Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me sir. Sir? Yes? Uh. Ah if you dont mind my asking could you tell me where you got your glasses? Malaysia. Malaysia? Yeah. Uhm look I know thisll sound odd but can I buy them from you? Actually I was gonna buy a new pair. (positive) Oh! (little chuckle) But I I can barely see without these. Cmon. Well these were expensive. Lets start the bidding. So you didnt think this was a date? N... no not really. Why is it... a date? I thought it was a date. No. Its not a date. What about the regards? Regards dont mean anything. I mean its not like I said hi. Hey the fact is... (sighs) I shouldnt say anything. No tell me. Can you keep a secret? Me? Oh yeah. (deep breath) I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick. But h... he was so brave and... and gained such a wonderful perspective on life. I... I fell in love with him. Oh the guys got some perspective there. Hey do you know what the Whip does? What whip? The Whip. In the Senate in the House. Well you know in the old days when the senators didnt vote the way that the party leaders wanted em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to or theres gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect) She wont talk to anyone huh? Oh no she wont say a word to anybody. Well shes talking a blue streak now Jack! Well well. The white whale. (frustrated) Oh look at this. Theres no place to park around here. I dont even know why they sell cars in Manhattan. Dont complain at least you have your health. George look out for that man! (to escaping car) Hey! Hey get back here! (looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale! Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street? Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that? No. Definitely not. Yeah. Im pretty sure I wouldnt. And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop. The one who always sits by herself? Yeah! How did he do that? Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee. Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective! She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness so he can get some phony hair has perspective? (opening door to leave) He picked her up? Walked right over to her table. Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket) Jake Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw see youre not the only one who has em. I have them too. Where did you get those? Malaysia. I was in the area. (surprised) Kramer. Just drive. All right. Now you listen and you listen good. I know who you are. Youre the scofflaw.

You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom and then that big phony mat coming down on top of em. Well some of em look good. The ones that look good you dont even know about. What if you get involved with a woman? Howre you gonna tell her? The way they make em these days Ill never have to tell her. So you keep it a secret your whole life then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) Here Mrs Costanza I thought you might want this. (as Mrs Costanza horrified) Aahh! Its no secret that its my dream to have my own publishing house and if this Jake Jarmel book does you know what I think its gonna do. If I can get this whole thing off the ground then  you know I think Ill have something for you. (laughs) Oh Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks. Yeah by the way those are great glasses. Oh really you like em? Uh huh. Very unusual. Well you know what? (removes glasses) What? (hands them over) You can have em. Oh no no no. (waves them away) Please. No no no no. Go to that place on the corner theyll change the prescription in an hour. Take em. Really? Yeah Ive no use for them anymore. Honestly. (accepting) I could use a new pair of reading glasses. Theyre from Malaysia. (putting on spectacles) Oh yeah? (admiring gasp) Fabulous. Well Mr Newman in all my years on the bench I have never come across anything quite like this. I have given this matter some very serious consideration and Ive decided that whats best for the city and possibly for yourself is for you to keep your car in a garage... ...convenient to your home. (sobbing) I cant afford that! Afford it you will Mr Newman. Or this court will see that your car is impounded... ...and sold at auction. Well dont you worry your honour. Hes in my custody. (to Jerry) Well what dyou think? (unimpressed) I really cant say. No say. I want you to say. Its not good okay. Its not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) Im sorry. You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp. (examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good. Why dont you get a pair of white shoes move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with? (to salesman) Well maybe you could show me something else. As I said itll be different once we design something specifically for you. But I dont think your friend here is being very helpful. Oh hey Im being helpful. I am the only one being helpful! (getting annoyed) No I dont think youre being helpful! I think youre being disruptive and you make it very difficult for your friend here to improve his life! Hey! Im trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally! (angry) All you people with hair think youre so damn superior! You have no idea what its like. You ever look down in the bottom of your tub and see a fist fulla hair? Howd you like to start your day with that?! (looks ready to punch Jerry) All right! Take it easy! Take it easy. (leaps to feet) Jerry! Im sorry. Please. (sits again) Hey Jerry th... (spots George) George you decided to get a rug! Good for you Jack! Well Im Im just looking. Oh. (to salesman) Uh Tommy Im gonna need a little adjustment. Ill be right with you. Listen George I got some bad news. Im not gonna be able to give you that parking space. What? What? This judge has to use it for some scofflaw. And you know you cant fight City Hall. You know Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day... (to George) You didnt?! (admiring himself in mirror) I did. (advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct) (indistinct) Im not a hundred percent recovered yet! Gimme that thing! Hows your life? All right? Yeah not bad at all. (at lectern) And now uh ladies and gentlemen of the press it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr Jake Jarmel. (he applauds Jake as he vacates the lectern in his favour) So Jake whats your percentage on this book? Oh actually I uh I have some very interesting information on that. (puts on glasses) You know uh this is a co-venture and as... (notices glasses) Where did you get those? ... as such it... Those glasses where did you get those glasses? (confused) Where... what? (to Elaine) Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke on me? Because its not very funny. (to the nonplussed Lippman) Give me those! (yelling) I want the glasses! Give me those! (mouths) Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.]

I think he looks fantastic. Oh come on. No I never realized what an attractive man he is. Hey people people people people people. Not bad huh? Excuse me. You look ridiculous in that thing. Is that so? Or could it be that youre just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat? Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain. Ha ha ha ha oh all right go ahead deride deride if you must. But let me tell you something with my personality and this set of hair you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. Im a player. You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman she called me up this morning shes moving into the city and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her. Well what about me? No I think hes got you beat buddy. So shes gorgeous. Oh yeah last time I saw her she was five years ago. Well have you got a picture? No. Well I have to see her. Hey I know what we can do. Ive got a friend who works over at the police station. Hes a composite artist. Really? Yeah yeah maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you. Oh I would love that. You think hed really do it? Yeah yeah. I think he will. It sounds like an excellent idea. Hey Jerry you want this cause Im going to give it to a homeless person. Well Im very excited about this. Ive always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it. Here you go brother. Some food for you. Thank you. Youre a good man. Bless you. Now are you going to be here in an hour? Where am I going?

You want to meet her? Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman? Yeah I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side. Hey man. Enjoy the food? Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like that? Oh listen Ill take that Tupperware now. I dont think so. Woah woah thats mine. You gave it to me. No no I didnt say you could keep it. You see I dont give away tupperware. You should have said something. I didnt think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume. Ive really got to thank you for this. Well by now you think people would be a little more open minded. Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom. So um you and Robert. Yes indeed. Im surprised. Really. Why? No reason. Well believe me this didnt happen overnight. Roberts not exactly a *one* *woman* *man* if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure I mean in a lot of ways hes a typical guy he likes his sports but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. Its those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is. Oh hi honey. Oh it was such a great night. And did they suspect anything? No I was a fantastic beard. I held hands I called him honey. And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals. Oh it was such a great night. Oh. You said that already. Oh I did? Yeah. Oh. Oh no. Dont tell me. You like him? Hes incredible. Yeah but? Yeah I know. So? What? Not conversion. Youre thinking conversion? Well it did occur to me. You think you can get him to just change teams? Hes not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it. Why? Is it irrevocable? Because when you join that team its not a whim. He likes his team. Hes set with that team. Weve got a good team. Yeah we do. We do have a good team. Why cant he play for us? Theyre only comfortable with *their* equipment. We just got along *so* great. Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when theres no possibility of sex. No no no I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry. You realize youre venturing into uncharted waters. I realize that. Are you that desperate? Yes I am. So are you going to bring your gun?... All right then its settled. First date no weapons... All right Ill see you then... Okay bye. What are you looking for? Tupperware. Sorry. I dont have any tupperware. I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole but now it wont keep because I have no Tupperware. What about a plastic bag? You must be kidding. What is the difference? The patented burp Jerry. It locks in freshness. So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night. Oh yeah you talked to her. Yeah for two hours. Shes nuts about you. Yeah well we go way back. Why didnt anything happen between you two? Whos to say it didnt? So did you describe yourself to her over the phone? Yes I did. What did you say to her? What do you think I said? I dont know. I told her the truth. As you see it? Yes as I see it. Did you tell her about uh your little hat there? What hat? You know youre little hair hat there. No. Dont you think she could tell? No no no she cant tell. Its a perfect match. Beautiful job. Are you kidding? I could spot that birds nest two blocks away. You only think that because you know me. Have you noticed people staring at your head? I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see. Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it. No hes not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald I never would have introduced him. Look I guarantee she wont know. Yeah thats it. All right Im going to go down to the precinct. Im going to have lunch with Lou. Oh Ill split a cab with you. Hey Im really sorry about the other day. Really sorry. Hey thats my coffee! Hi Sarge. Hi Im sorry Im late. Some of our lineup decoys didnt show. Hey any of you guys want to be in the lineup? Make a quick 50 bucks? Sure. I will. Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert. All of you turn to the left. The left. Now turn to the right. (thinking to himself) Oh my god there she is. Thats the face just like the picture. George? Yeah. Hi. Its great to meet you. Likewise. Have you been waiting long? No no. I just got here. A few minutes ago. Good good. Well why dont you take off your hat and stay awhile. Whats that? A polygraph. Its what you civilians call a lie detector test. Oh. Let me ask you when someone is lying is it true that their pants are actually on fire? If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up here. A certain cast member of Melrose Place. Really. Have you ever seen the show? No. You can admit it Jerry. Its okay. I admit it. I dont watch it. Hey Lou maybe we should put him on the poly. The poly? Yeah. I think youve seen it. Melrose Place? Yes. Melrose Place. I just didnt know you watched that. Well I do. I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation. Well maybe I was a little embarrassed. You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane... And Billy and Jake and Allison yes we could have discussed it. Why? Why were you so embarrassed? The point is Im going to be taking this lie detector test and that needles going to be going wild. That is *so* stupid. Why dont you just confess? Its too stupid to confess. Look at what Im confessing to. So what are you going to do? I dont know. Maybe I can beat the machine. Oh who do you think you are? Castanza? Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful duplicitous deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me? Oh god this tastes terrible. Did you shake it up? No. You gotta shake it up. No. Im sick of shaking. Youve got to shake everything. Yeah thats a real nuisance. This is killing me. So Im going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife. So tonight are you going to make the move? Yeah I think I might. Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it? Thats an interesting question. How so? How so? Ill tell you how so. Shes bald! What do you mean bald? What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald. Shes bald? Shes bald. Oh come on. Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror. Well maybe she got a haircut or something. Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says Give me the Larry Fine. Women go bald? Yeah Ive heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig. Hey. Hey. You fixed me up with a bald woman. Bald? Yeah thats right. Do you see the irony here? Youre rejecting somebody because theyre bald. So? (puts her hands up to her mouth) Youre bald! No Im not. I *was* bald. Elaine. No no no Elaine. (shouting) I dont like this thing. And heres what Im doing with it. Nooooo. Hahaha whyd you start that fight with me? Well I figured thats what couples do. You almost convinced me we were a couple. Well it was easy. Really. Well good night Ill call you tomorrow. Oh uh wait a second. Would you like to come upstairs? Upstairs? Yeah. Upstairs? Elaine... I was hoping you know that you might be interested in... changing teams? Changing teams? Have you ever thought about it? But Im a starting shortstop. Robert we need a shortstop. *Real bad*. I tell you when she threw that toupee out the window it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate completely insecure paranoid neurotic its a pleasure. Good to have you back. And you know what else Ive decided to do? Im going to keep seeing the bald woman. Shes as good as anybody else. Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasnt a lot of hair on it. Yeah youve had like a religious awakening. Youre like a bald-again. Going to need a little more coffee here. So George how do I beat this lie detector? Im sorry Jerry I cant help you. Come on youve got the gift. Youre the only one that can help me. Jerry I cant. Its like saying to Pavorotti Teach me to sing like you. All right well Ive got to go take this test. I cant believe Im doing this. Jerry just remember. Its not a lie... if you believe it. Hey I did it. What? I turned him. He defected. Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that? Because Im a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom. Elaine do you know what youve done? Youve give hope to every woman whos ever said Too bad hes gay. Well its a lesson for the kids out there. Anythings possible. Jeromy I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping. Whats your name? Jerry Seinfeld. What is your address? 129 West 81st street. Did Kimberly steal Jos baby? I dont know. Did Billy sleep with Allisons best friend? I dont know. Did Janes finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? And if so did she enjoy it? I dont know. Did Jane sleep with Michael again? (He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean shes crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane she makes me so mad. He went back? What do you mean he went back? He went back. I dont understand it. You were having such a great time the sex the shopping. Well heres the thing. Being a woman I only really have access to the uh... equipment what thirty forty-five minutes a week. And thats on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment and have access to it twenty-four hours a day their entire lives. You cant. Thats why they lose very few players. Yeah I guess I never really stood a chance. Well theres always a place for you on our team. Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on? Yeah. Its coming on in a few minutes. Okay. Hey. Dont worry it hasnt started. Hey George I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what youve done. Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaines proud of me Jerry. What is the matter? I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair* told me that I wasnt her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy. Well Ill tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didnt you? I didnt ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did and it made him act like a jerk. All right shut up shut up Melrose Place is coming on. Oh that Michael I hate him hes just so smug. Hey how you doing Stu? Eddie my man. You again? Boy youre a slippery one. Youd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy. Ive got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup? Thats the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. The tall guy with the with the high hair. Id recognize him anywhere. Hey you you with the high hair step forward. Me?]
99,6,17,[Say its Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco? I would think. So you could call a woman for a date ask her if shes free for Dinner and a flamenco? (scoffs) You dont flamenco on the first date. Boy I wish the flamenco was popular here. Yeah? Would you do it? Yes I think I would. Well I knew youd have an affinity for it because its the dance of a very proud people. Hello. (listens) Oh hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh alright okay. Dont worry about it. (listens) Okay Ill see you later. Alright bye. I have to go over to my grandmothers. What for? I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her. So what no lunch? No we have time. Oh. Hows she doing? Ah shes starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present. Ah. You know theres gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube. Like toothpaste? Ya-hah. Theres a squeeze ketchup. Ive seen squeeze mustard. Ive never seen squeeze ketchup. Well if they make squeeze mustard doesnt it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup? Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze. I really dont see the difference. Oh theres a difference. Its subtle. Its subtle. Hey uh isnt Elaine supposed to meet us? (looking ahead) Yeah there she is. Uh-oh. What? Ah shes with her friend Wendy. Wendy? Is that the uh physical therapist? Yeah. Im on a kiss hello program with her. Really? Yeah. Every time I see her I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once on her birthday somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it. (from a distance) Hey. You know Im down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia. Ah thats fortunate. I really admire that. (surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything. No I told you I admire your hearing. No dont slough that off you have great hearing. Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.) (to Wendy) Wendy George. (to George) Wendy. Youre uh physical therapist right? Yes. You know I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) Its kinda painful. What dyou make of it? (warning) George. Have you tried heat and ice on it? (reluctant) Oh that uh that seems like a lotta trouble. Well you could come by my office later I could work on it for you a little. (happy) Oh! Okay. Let me give you my card. Oh thank you. Well Ill see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye Elaine. Bye Wendy. Im sorry. Bye Jerry. Bye. (slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for? What? (pinching Georges arm) Ask about your arm. I still dont see why I cant ask her about my arm. Shes a physical therapist. She doesnt want to have to deal with that outside of the office. Why not? Because it is what she does. I love these people you cant ask em questions. (getting excited) Theyre so mentally gifted that we mustnt disturb the delicate genius unless its in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved then the delicate genius can be disturbed! George you got a little something right here. (wiping the area with a hand) People think theyre so important... (adamant) Well Im going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her. Why? Well you know frankly outside of a sexual relationship I dont see the point to it. Im not thrilled with all the handshaking either but one step at a time. (regarding the menu) Whatre you getting? (to Elaine) And whats with that hairdo by the way? Huh yeah I know. Its not very flattering. She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her. Oh I could never say anything to her about that. Yeah. Kramers the only person who could say something like that. Yeah. Hah. Well just tell Kramer to tell her. No. If you tell him to do it hell never do it. What you have to do is introduce him and then hell just come out with it. (sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes yes youre right. Thats right. Ill bring her over to meet... (to Kramer) ...Kramer. Hello boys and girls. Speak of the devil. Yeah. Hey listen I uh I need a picture of you buddy. What for? Well Im uh Im putting everybodys picture up in the lobby of our building. Why? So everyone will know everybodys name. See people are gonna be a lot friendlier. (reluctant) I I dont want my picture plastered up in the lobby. Imagine walking by someone on the floor and you say Hey Carl! and he says Hey Jerry! You see thats the kind of society I wanna live in. (still reluctant) Kramer I dont wanna stop and talk with everyone every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way. (to Elaine) You know your eyeliners smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup? (to Jerry indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine. Ma! Again with the ketchup? Dont they have em in the plastic squeeze containers? (traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello! Hello uncle Leo! Whatre you doing here? Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle. Yeah me too. Hello Jerry. Hi Nana. Arent you gonna kiss her hello? Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course. Ha well heres the bottle. (grabbing the bottle) Ill do it. (also grabbing) Whatre you doing I got it. Give it to me. Will you stop it. Jerry will you give me the bottle? Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it! You should let Buddy open it. Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago. Leo did you give Helen the fifty dollars? What fifty dollars? Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week and he gave you a hundred and you were supposed to give fifty dollars to your sister. Ma dad died in nineteen-sixty-two. (laughing off Nanas confusion) Believe me. I dont owe your mother fifty dollars. Im just not getting any hot water. Hey believe me I know theres nothing worse than when your showers not working. Im gonna take care of it as soon as I can Jerry. Thanks Julio. Awright. Huh? (surprised) Hey hey hey hey. Hello! Whats going on here? (evasive) Ohh nothing nothing. (suspicious) Well then whatre you doing? Oh I I need a pen. What for? Well Im making out my will. Oh I got a big slice of dough for you buddy. And you too Elaine I havent forgotten you. (accusingly) Youre looking for a picture of me arent you? You got that straight. I told you forget it. Oh come on Jerry. If everybody knew everybody we wouldnt have the problems we have in the world today. Well you dont rob somebody if you know their name! Youre robbing me. Well Im gonna get your picture and youre gonna participate in my program. Wha... W.. Are you going home? Yeah. Uh could you come back in about five minutes? Why? No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again. (removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendys coming? Yeah shell be here any second. Well thisll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this? Listen Jerry. She never dates and I know its because of her hair. Hello. Oh hi mom. Yeah I was at Nanas yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey mom let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesnt know what year it is and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well I think you should. Okay bye. Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to over fifty-three years? Oh Morty please. Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And thats figuring conservatively at five percent interest over fifty-three years compounded quarterly. Or if you put it into a ten-year T-bill... Morty will you stop it! (determined) Well hes not getting away with this! Yeah? Wendy. Come on up. Well this is it. Shall I go get Kramer? No no hell come in. Well this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello. What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebodys face? Its the obligation you know? As soon as this person comes in you know you have to do this. I mean if you could say touch a breast as part of the kiss hello then I think I could see the value in it a little better. How bout an intercourse hello? How would that be? Elaine now youre being ridiculous. (indicating) Thats her. Thats her. Hi/Hey. (muffled) Hi Wendy. Oh hi Jerry. (muffled) Would you like something to drink? Sure. (muffled) There you go. (taking the bottle) Ah. Oh look at that. Im almost outta Klondike bars. So hows everything going? Oh okay. Oh your friend George came by the office the other day and then yesterday he cancelled on me. Oh yeah he had to take his mother to the chiropodist. Oh you hear that? That must be Kramer. Hey! Jerry! Cmon thats not fair! I told you I was gonna get it. No cmon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture. (holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no. (throws up his hands) Alright fine. Put my picture up. What do I care? Uh Kramer. Kramer Id like you to meet my friend Wendy. Oh hello. (holds out her hand) Hi. (shaking hands) Yeah. (points) You know I really like that hairdo. (flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be time for a change. (hopeful) Oh you were? Well I... (interrupting) Oh no no no. You dont wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that. Kramer if she wants to change her hair... No no. youd be a damn fool to change it. Its very becoming. Oh well. (laughs flattered) Oh ho. So whos that friend of yours? That guy that came in. Oh Kramer. Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend? You wanna go out with him? Well why not? Well its just that... uh I dont... What is there anything wrong with him? Elaine? Im just thinking about the question. You know my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque) (perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow. (tearing out cheque) Yeah same time. (hands over cheque) There you go. Oh. Ah you owe a hundred and fifty. What for? Well you cancelled on Tuesday and our policy is twenty-four hours notice for all cancellations. (agitated) Well I I couldnt come. I I had to drive my mother to to the chiropodist. Whats the problem? (harassed) Are you aware that Im being charged for Tuesdays appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist. Well Im sorry thats our policy. (after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door. So. Will you be here tomorrow? Well its less than twenty-four hours so I guess I have to! Hey! (indicating photos) So what dyou think? You like it? Oh my god! Look at that picture its terrible... ...You cant put that picture up. Well its not a beauty contest. Its just a way for people to get to know one another. Hey Cosmo. Hey... ...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah you see? Hey Kramer my friend Wendy wants to go out with you. (interested) Well how do you do? Hello (finds the right photo) Jerry. Oh. Hello uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary. You know Ive seen you so many times and now we can finally talk to each other. (keen) What was I telling you? Isnt this nice? (not really) Yeah. Jerry. You know could you help me with a package? Oh sure yeah. Thank you. Oh no! You see? Thats just what I need. More kissing! (laughs) Hee hee hee. Hee hee hee... What is so funny? Nothing nothing. (laughs out loud) Hello. Oh hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didnt?! He couldnt! (listens) Alright I will. (listens) Okay bye. (aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home! Why? (suspicious) I dont know. Maybe to keep her quiet. Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah. (not as eager) Hi Joan. How you doing? Pretty good. Just pretty good? Not great? Okay great. Are you happy? Oh Im delighted. Okay. Have a nice day. You too. Hi Jerry. Hi Louise. Hey. Ah well. Thank you very much! For what? (agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! Im like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long boring tedious conversation. I cant even get out of the building! You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now youre part of a family. Family? Yeah. You think I want another family? My fathers demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing Cosmo Kramer whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. Theres no more kissing and I dont care what the consequences are. Oh hi. Mister Costanza we were trying to get in touch with you. Wendy cant make her appointment. What dyou mean? She had some personal affair she had to attend to. I left a message on your machine. You didnt get it? When did you leave the message? Few hours ago. (pointedly) Oh Im sorry I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now as I see it you owe me seventy-five dollars. Look Mister Costanza... Will that be cash or cheque? I am really glad I took the day off. Oh yeah theres nothing better than skiing. Yeah. I hope my clients werent too upset. Ugh the hell with em.

Yes its very strange. Very strange. Ive never heard of anything like this. I mean its almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says Well this is as far as I can take you. I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking youd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that. I had to carry my skis and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder. You should have her work on it for you. Yeah alright I gotta go. Hi Jerry. Hi Mary. Uh listen. I decided I cant kiss hello anymore. Im sorry. Its nothing personal.... ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I cant do it. Im sorry. Hi Jerry.

Its nothing personal its just Im not really able to do it and uh Im sorry. (as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation. Hello. Jerry? Hi mom. So whats happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you? Well he said no. He said we had no proof. No proof? Well get him. Hes a crook sooner or later hell slip up. Uh anyway I want you to go check on Nana at the home. Okay I will. Dyou realise an above-average performing growth mutual fund for fifty-three years... Whats up? (locking his door) Oh I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home. Oh. Hey Kramer look at this.

You know she really doesnt belong here. My uncle put her here Because hes trying to prove he doesnt owe my mother fifty dollars. Well she seems very happy. She met an old friend who used to live next door to her. Buddy? Yes thats his name. Hes right over there. (smiling) Im sorry I dont owe you anything. I had some personal business that day.

I mean why dont you two just take your business elsewhere hmm? Oh huh huh that is a good idea. Cmon George. Yeah. Lets go. (pointedly) And you know you might wanna do something about that hair. Why whats wrong with my hair? Huh I think its a little old-fashioned. Dont you? (to receptionist) Uh tell her. Shes right. So you were with him that day at the track? Oh yeah. He won a thousand dollars. His son was there too. Leo? Yeah thats it. Leo. Ooh what an obnoxious little kid. He used to steal my soda bottles. and cash em in for the deposits uh? Is that so? And after your grandfather hit the daily double he gave him a hundred dollars and told him to give fifty to his sister. His sister? Why I tell you he shoulda give it to me for all the bottles he took! Well thats very interesting. (standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track. (defensive) One second... (with a triumphant point) Youre busted! Hey Steve. How you doing? Hey Jeff. Whats happening? Mary! Oh Mary! Give us a kiss. Dont be like that Mary. Cmon I made a mistake! (contemptuous) Look why dont you do everybody a favour and just get out of this building? (angry) Nobody wants you here. Nobody!

Well uh you know Id invite you in but uhm... you know. (rueful acceptance) Oh yeah I understand.]
100,6,18,[Whoah whoah whoah. (rises and turns to Jerry) May I help you? (indicates with his thumb) Yeah Im just going up to see Elaine Benes. (unfriendly smile) Benes? (moves toward Jerry) No-one here by that name. Oh shes uh shes house-sitting for Mr. Pitt. Oh. House-sitting mmm. Yeah. Whatre you the boyfriend? Here for a... quickie? Can I just go up? Oh I get it. Why waste time making small talk with the doorman? I should just shut up and do my job opening the door for you. How bout those Knicks? Oh I see. On the sports page... Yeah. ...What makes you think I wasnt reading the Wall Street page? Oh I know because Im the uneducated doorman. So you think your parentsll get back together? I hope so. I cant take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha it stinks up the whole house. Hey George stick em up. What? For these German tourists. Pretend that Im robbing you. Why? So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. Itll give them a thrill. Awright hands up porky! Thats it. Now gimme your wallet. Got it in here huh fat boy! (aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?! Alright thats enough. Ill tell you when its enough! (he releases George) Alright now you better not say anything or Ill stalk you! Whereve you been? Were gonna miss the movie lets go. I am not going back down there. I cant face that guy again. What guy? The doorman. I dont wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off? Six. But then the night doorman comes on. Hes much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha. Well its almost six now. Cant we just wait til he goes home? (unhappy) I... Well still make the movie. (accepting) Okay okay. Whatd you do today dad? Today I went record shopping in Greenwich Village. I bought this record but I cant seem to find the hi-fi. I dont have a hi-fi. Didnt I give you my old record player? (leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo. Cosmo? Whos Cosmo? Im Cosmo. Well I want it back. I wanna listen to that cha-cha record. (little dance) One-two cha-cha-cha. (coming back in) Alright alright. Can we go out and eat? (putting down the bowl) Lemme change my shirt. Jerry its six. (claps her hands) Lets go. Uh that doormans still milling around outside. Hes very peculiar. No dont... (picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh hi Mr. Pitt. (quietly) Give that to me. (taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. Hows Scotland? (concerned) Elaine are you having a party? A party. Oh no that was just my stupid friend Jerry. Alright he just left. We can go. (stern) Because theres to be no entertaining while Im gone. Believe me were not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh can you grab those empty bottles for me. I need to know whats in the mail. Oh well Mr. Pitt theres really nothing that cant wait. Were trying to catch a movie. (resolute) Well you better catch the later show because I need to know whats in the mail. Alright. (to Jerry upset) I cant go. ...Uhm the new Time magazine. The new People... (piqued interest) Oh whos on the cover? Hey buddy. (surprise) You? Wh...whatre you doing here? You work at this building too? Ah sure. Poor doorman has to work two jobs to put food on the table for mother and baby. (supercilious) No I live here. Thats okay isnt it? So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building? You got a problem with that? Look Im not going in your building. I really dont have to talk to you. Goodbye. (calling after Jerry) You really think youre better than me dont you?! My father opened his shirt... Yeah and? (nods to Kramer) Tell him Kramer. (matter of fact) He had breasts. What dyou mean breasts? (waves his hands) Big breasts! So what? A lot of older men have that. No not these. These were real hooters. I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game. Well maybe youre gonna get em too George. (worried) Yeah thats right. What if its a genetic thing like father like son? But your fathers not bald. No no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather. Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother. You know Frank cant be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support. You mean like a bra? A bra is for ladies. Im talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men. Boy that brain never stops working does it? I tell you Im gonna go noodle with this. (indicating her shirt with her finger) Hey were twins. (thinking she means the breasts) What!! Our shirts. Theyre the same. Oh Huh imagine that. (to Jerry) What? Whatd you say to the doorman? What? Nothing. (sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home and started harassing him. What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! Whatd I do to him? Cos I asked him about the Knicks? Hey did you make the movie? No. You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up. Alright. Can we go to a later show so hes off his shift when I come by? Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman? Yes we do. What is wrong with George? Hes... trying to get something off his chest. (agitated) Alright I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands. Help you? (jumps in surprise) Hoh! Whatre you doing here? Youre supposed to be gone. I traded shifts with the night doorman. He had some personal affairs to attend to. You see my fellow doorman and I watch out for each other. We dont stab each other in the back like people in your world. (trying to ease the tension) Look I dont want any trouble. I dont have a doorman in my building. I guess Im just not used to talking to them. Id really just like to be friends. You wanna be friends? Id like to be. Then watch the door for a minute would you? What? Yeah I just wanna run and get a beer. Ill be back in a minute. Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do? Its not brain surgery. You open the door for people who live here. And if they dont live here dont let them in. (takes off his hat) Here. (putting it on Jerrys head) Wear that. Oh. (to the man in the elevator) Hey hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello! Hey hey wait a second. You live here? (indignant) Of course I live here. Ive lived here for twenty years. Now if you dont let me in Im going to call the police and have you arrested. (after the guy) You think youre better than me? (indicating) You have to sign for it. Oh right. (with a smile) Hey how bout those Knicks huh? (dismissive) Yeah yeah yeah. Hey. I uh brought back your record player huh. Thank you Kramer. Yeah. (indicating a chair) Put it over there. So how you feeling? Tired. Uh huh. Your back hurt? How did you know? Well its obvious you know. Youre carrying a lot of extra baggage up there. (looks down and indicates his chest) Up here? Oh yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen Frank have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you this is just a prototype. You want me to wear a bra?! No no. A bra is for ladies. Meet the bro. So is your father excited about coming home? George? (broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma? All of a sudden youre interested in your grandmother? Well you know. You get to a certain point you wanna know about your roots. She was a lovely woman. Yuh. What about physically? Physically? Yeah you know whatd she uh look like? Well youve seen pictures. (to himself) You cant tell much from those pictures. So what? Was she uh was she a big uh woman? Big? No just my height. Bosomy? Bosomy? You wanna know if your grandmother was bosomy?! (trying to laugh it off) No I was just wondering. The information could be relevant. Where do you get your genes from?! (to himself) Thats what Id like to know. I cant believe you left your post. He left me there. You see the mind games? (to one of the tenants) Hey whats up? Whats going on here? (quietly to Jerry) Jerry lets get out of here. Yeah. (shocked) Oh my god! What were you doing watching the door anyway? He asked me to. We were getting along. (thinking) You know my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows youre a friend of mine. Hell tell that co-op lady shell tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry Im in this too deep. Dont you find it odd that as soon as he leaves the couch gets stolen? Maybe hes setting me up! (taking command) Alright shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight. Alright well what if we say... Alright (claps hands) here it is. This is what well tell em. You came to pick me up... I came to pick you up. Yeah. Thats what I just said. I know. I was just... Yeah I know what you were just. Its not helping. Alright well. Just start again then. Okay you came to pick me up at... Right. You see? Again. What? I said right. Alright you came right upstairs without talking to the doorman. But the doormans gonna say that I was there. (intense) So what? No-ones gonna believe a doorman! But I dont know if this is gonna work. (aggressive with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. Well be fine. Let me do the talking! Okay. Good. Now fix me a drink. Hows that feel? This feels very comfortable. You see? I feel ten years younger. Yeah and your postures a lot better. Look at you. And I can breathe easier too. I told you! Now Frank listen. Heres what Im thinking. Now you have a friend in the bra business right? Of course. Sid Farkus. Hes the best in the business. (claps his hands) Heres our chance. What dyou say? Itll be me you and the bro bro. Lets do it! Except we gotta do something about the name. Why whats wrong with bro? No bros no good. Too ethnic. Alright you got something better? How bout uh... the mansiere? Mansiere? Thats right. A brassiere for a man. The mansiere get it? (upset) Well youve scared her off. We may never see mom again. Hey George what dyou like better? The bro or the mansiere? Dad. We need to talk. I had to use the bathroom so I asked this guy to watch the door for a few minutes. Why should I believe you? (indicating Elaine) Actually it was her friend. I was just speaking to the doorman here about the couch robbery. Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And pray tell what did the doorman say? He said he asked a friend of yours to watch the door. (dismissive) Oh my. Well the doorman certainly has a wild imagination doesnt he? Well... what do we have here? Perhaps Miss Benes could explain why a Jerry Seinfeld signed for this package (handing the package to Mrs. Payton) at the exact same time the couch was stolen. (in a rush) He never watched a door before Mrs Payton he didnt know how to do it. (pleading) You know hes a comedian Mrs Payton they dont know how to do anything. (desperate) Dont you see whats going on here? He set us up. Hes playing all these mindgames. Youre saying Im responsible for the couch? (worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it. (livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one! Is it possible we were victims of a sting? Im sure hes having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies. No. I was just messing with his head. Anyway Jerry... Jerry? We have to replace the couch. Now we have to buy a new couch?! (crafty) Not necessarily. Why dont you take back the couch you gave me? The one with the Poppie stain?! Yeah sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) Hes gotta move out. But its got a pee-stain on it. No the cushions turned over. (not sure) I guess. (enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldnt be more perfect! Now its called the bro. Or the mansiere. Yeah but I prefer the bro. I like mansiere. Well I have to tell you its a very interesting idea. Yeah. You know selling bras exclusively to women were really only utilising fifty percent of the market. (to Kramer) Thats what we figured huh? (to Frank) I told you. And to be perfectly frank Ive always felt I could use some support. I know when Im wearing Banlon there appears to be some jiggling. (vehement) I wouldnt be caught dead in Banlon. (indicating the bro) So uh what dyou see in the back? Hooks? Velcro? What? Uh. Definitely velcro. Say youre getting intimate with a woman uh you dont want her fumbling and struggling back there. I think weve all experienced that. Summer nights. (pointing at Farkus) Very funny. Well I still have to talk about this to Mr. Degrunmont... Of course yes. ...But barring any unforeseen developments gentlemen I think were sitting on a winner. (sympathy) Frank I wanna tell you how sorry I am to hear about you and Estelle separating. Oh thank you Sid but thats all in the past. Im ready to move on. (thoughtful) Ive always been very fond of Estelle. Beautiful woman. I uh I hope you dont think uh this is out of line but would it be okay with you if I were to ask her out? (anger) You wanna go out with my wife?! (rage) Where do you get the nerve to ask me something like that?! Oh no Frank I was just saying... I know what youre saying and I know what youre thinking!! No Frank... Cmon Cosmo Im not doing business with this guy. Frank! Jerry took the couch back. He took it back? Didnt you tell him I was using it? Oh I pleaded with him. Where am I supposed to sleep? Well I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Moms coming to get you. I thought Jerry didnt want that couch because of the stain? What stain? Oh you didnt notice? It has a pee-stain. (disbelief) You had me sleeping on a pee-stained couch? (light) No. No no no. The cushion was turned over. (anger) But the very idea. you had me lying in urine!! Ah! Theres mom theres mom. Is it safe to come in? Oh of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course. Youre not having any of your transvestite parties? Will you stop it? (to Kramer) I lived with him for forty years I never saw him trying on my underwear. As soon as he leaves the house he turns into J. Edgar Hoover! Here Cosmo... Oh hey. ...You can have the hi-fi. (hands it over) I dont need it now... Awright I got it. ...I got one at home. Alright lets go. Well go out for dinner tonight. I cant tonight Im busy. What dyou mean busy? Im having dinner with someone. With whom? Sid Farkus. (anger) Sid Farkus?! Youre not having dinner with a bra salesman. Hey he only sells them. He doesnt wear em. Okay thats it! Im not coming home! (upset) But you cant stay here. Theres no place to sleep! Well work something out. Stop him! Ja ja ja its him! Stop that man! Its him. Somebody stop him! Please quick. Stop its him. I know I know. Help. Stop him. Hey hey. (pointing) That record player is not yours. Now look. Somebody gave it to me. Youre a thief. We have proof. What is that? The first upper-body support undergarment specifically designed for men. How does it connect in the back? With a hook? Oh no no. (demonstrates) Here velcro. (to the portly German) Ooh (indistinct German) ...keine problem ah? Is gut ja? Well I suppose itll have to do. Its a beautiful couch. Its hardly been used. Poppie! Oh hello Jerry. Whatre you doing here? Visiting my friend. Ohh. Hey how you feeling? Oh much better much better. The doctors say I cannot have no aggravation. Hmm. So I sell the restaurant uh? I just take it easy. See if I get excited ats aggravated my condition. The last time I got aggravated was in the restaurant. With your friend. She start the big fight about abortion. Its you! Its you! Wha...? You! I... I gotta sit down! No Poppie! No!! Kasha? No. Thanks dad.]

Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)]

I was reading a manuscript I just couldnt put it down. nan My manuscript? nan How do you feel? nan Now that you mention it  a little woozy. nan Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript. nan Im not going back in there!! nan all right then where is it?? nan I left it on the coffee table or somethin Well wh..wh.what are you doing? nan Im going in . nan Didnt you see the sign on the door? nan Well I thought it was so your parents wouldnt walk in while youre with a girl. nan ( Heavy Panting) Its not on any table Kramer. Where is it? nan Well I dont know . I was in the bathroom  the kitchen... Okay... bathroom....kitchen. nan Can you get me a soda? nan Jerry I had some milk I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building. nan (again pants) I couldnt find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway? nan I dont know. Who couldve been in my apartment. nan I ve looked everywhere  even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldnt.... Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers? nan Yeah! nan Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! Ive got him. nan Newman . Open the door Newman I know youre in there. nan Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise. nan Theres nothing pleasant about it so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it.. nan Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .Thats preposterous. How can I  give you fleas. Now if you dont mind... Oh! but I do. Theres probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around) So  you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state of disrepair. Maybe you live in squalor. You know Newman  the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while no matter how much will power a person may have. It wont matter because theyre crawling  crawling on your skin. Up your legs  up your spine  up your back..... (Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....Im ripped with fleas ( scratches furiously) Oh! Oh! That feels good. Hey! This guy charges a hundred bucks an hour but Im telling ya hes worth every penny OOOOHH! nan Im next. nan Hey! Leo get this four movies at once; Pay Per View. nan I love these nuts. nan This Champagnes gone flat. ( throws her glass over her shoulder) Nana!!! nan He Ha Ha Ha...Let the chambermaid clean it up Hello.. nan Whats the matter?... Well I spoke to Elaine... Hey! Look  no shave. nan No...Why should that make any difference to you? nan It doesnt.. nan Of course not. You dont care what I look like. nan Thats right I dont. nan I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldnt care? nan Not a wit. nan Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and Id be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too. nan You can wear sweatpants. nan I could.. nan (seductively) You could drape yourself in velvet for all I care. nan Velvet... Did you read the whole thing? nan Oh! yeah. nan Huh . So Whats it about? nan Well its a story about love deception greed lust and...unbridled enthusiasm. nan unbridled enthusiasm...? nan Well  thats what led to Billy Mumphreys downfall. nan Oh! boy. nan You see Elaine Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue. nan Oh! my God. nan ah! Here we go. nan (to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks. nan May I..( pointing her food) (feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead. nan what is this? nan What? What are you doin? ( Kramer salting her food) I cant taste this. nan What are you talking about? nan This food it has no taste......nothin Im gettin nothin...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused) Hey thanks a lot for lettin me stay here. nan Well I dont keep pecans in the house so I didnt think itd be a problem. nan ( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn.. nan Whats the matter? nan I forgot my toothbrush. nan Oh! no problem.....You can use mine. nan Yours?....You know what Ill think Ill brush later. nan Brush now. nan (long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush) Newman Let me have a bite of your Macanaw.. nan What for you got your own. nan Come on cmon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin  Cant even taste a Macanaw. nan ( resumes eating) Well thats a shame. nan Waited all year and I cant even taste it.. nan You cant taste em . Why waste em . Why not give them all to me. nan Its a story about love  deception greed  lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm . nan Unbridled enthusiasm. nan Yeah!..tha..thats right. that Thats what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphreys downfall. nan hmmm...interesting take. So you believe has he not been so enthusiastic he could have adverted disaster. nan Yes...Ye..Yes..Thats right...You see Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue. nan So.. It was more a question of attitude than politics.. nan Yes yes Mr. Mandel. nan Hey! Under Siege is on again. Whose up for it? nan No more nuts. Awrghh..... Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Dont tell me.......Velvet!!! nan Its the real deal. nan Shes seen you in this thing. nan Thats right...We just had sex......You know Jerry Ive been searching for someone a long time.

Not to mention the damage to the room. nan Mr Mandel you dont understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas it could have killed me and my my other friend couldnt taste his peaches they only good for two weeks. nan I think  youve read one too many Billy Mumphrey stories.

103,6,21,[I hear youre going out with David Putty. Yeah. What is it a problem? Well I think he couldve asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine. Well I guess he figured you just wouldnt care. It *has* been a few years. Elaine you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You dont want it to be someone you know and you dont want it to be someone better than you. Now even though the latter is *obviously* impossible. Oh god. The former still applies. I dont know what it is but I just cant see you with a mechanic. Oh yeah. Right right. Well all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big* *muscular* arms on machines and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is. All right. Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day. So what if they have a lobster. Suddenly youre a shell-fish connoisseur. You know I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship it is *just* torture. So Im getting an eye job. An eye job? Ma you dont need an eye job. Georgie Im a divorcee. No youre not a divorcee. You&yuml;re just separated. Youre---youre a separatee. Well Im out there George. No youre not out there. I am too! Youre not out there! You cant be because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there theres not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence! Well anyway the operation is on Tuesday and I need you to drive me home because Ill be all drugged up. Tuesday? I cant do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run--- This is the only time the doctor *has*. Kramer hey hey! (Gets up out of his seat) Hi little buddy. Come on over and sit down. Hey listen I gotta go somewhere. No youre gonna sit down you son of a gun... All right Im sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek) So Kramer. Im getting an eye job. Oh yeah good for you. Hey you have to look your best. Youre out there now. Shes not out there! So who is your doctor? Uh Bakersoll. (whistles). Hes good. Hes *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban. Hey Kramer what are you doing Tuesday? Tuesday? Uh... Why doesnt *he* pick you up after the operation. Hes got the car with the bench seats that you like. Oh I dont care. Yeah I know but I cant drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates. Well giddy-up! Yeah Im here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer. Kramer.... (checks computer) All right... All righty... Sign right here please. (hands over clipboard) (signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh no these dont belong to me. Im not the Assman. I think theres been a mistake. Whats your name again? Cosmo Kramer. (checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman. No! Im not the Assman. Well as far as the state of New York is concerned you are. How do you feel? Fine. Something the matter? No. Then what is it? No nothing. Hi. I was with David *Putty* last night. Yeah so. He did the move. What move? You know...*the* move. Wait a second. *My* move? David Putty used *my* move? Yes yes. Are you sure? Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move. I cant believe it. He *stole* my move. What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat! Oh it wasnt like that! I didnt even mention you. You know we were in the garage. You know how garages are. Theyre conducive to sex talk. Its a high-testosterone area. Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs? Well Im going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it. Well wait---wait a second. What? Isnt that a little...rash? No! He stole my move! Yeah but...*I* like the move. Yeah but its like another comedian stealing my material. Well he doesnt even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*! Oh yeah. The pinch. *Ive* done the pinch. Thats not new. Besides which I dont know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted. You know its strange because hes such an honest mechanic. I know hes probably the only honest mechanic in New York. ...so he stole my move and hes using it on Elaine. You told David Putty your move and you didnt tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite. Can I just get it opened first? I cant believe youre hoarding sex moves. Im out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo. All right all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar). (takes a bite) Oh thats good. Thats very good. You feel better? Yeah much better. All right so whats the move because I need *something*. This woman Im dating its like shes doing her nails during love-making. Nancy Klopper? Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. Im working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. Id settle for a belch for gods sake. All right come on lets have it. All right George. Im gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure before--- Yeah yeah yeah. Its in the vault. Im putting it in the vault. Its not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along one must be certain that its going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used--- Youre gonna tell me...or not. All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? Youll need a headboard. I got a headboard. Is it padded? No. Good. How tall is she? Five-foot four. Why? You cant have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise you could really hurt your neck. I cant tell ya how much I appreciate this. George if you could master this youll never be alone again. Now the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. Im comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch which I find a little presumptuous. Is it a clockwise swirl? I prefer clockwise but its not written in stone. Here you go buddy. (shows it to Jerry). What is it? *Fusilli* Jerry! Its made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone? When did you do this? In my spare time. (turns to George). You know Im working on one of you George. Im using ravioli. See the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual. Oh... Why Fusilli? Because *youre* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah... Well thank you very much. So did you get your new plates? Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates. What do they say? Assman. Assman? Yeah. Assman Jerry. Im Cosmo Kramer the Assman! Who would order a license plate that says Assman? Maybe theyre Wilt Chamberlains. It doesnt have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass. Yeah or it could be a proctologist. Yeah. Proctologist. Come on! No doctor would put that on his car. Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party dont walk away. *Plant* yourself there because you will hear the funniest stories youve ever heard. See no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! Its always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way: It was a million to one shot Doc. Million to one. Oh! Theres my phone. (He leaves) So where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry) Ill tell you where Id like to stick it. Hey David. Oh hi Jerry. Hey whats the story? I hear youre doing my move. What move? What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine. Youre move? What are you kidding? I was doing that before I knew you. All you told me about was the ending. The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending its nothing. You had *nothing*. Oh that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it out anyway. I didnt need you to tell me that stupid twist. Swirl. Whatever. I dont even do it. Oh yeah I know. You do the *pinch*. Yeah thats right. You cant come up with your own stuff  so you *steal* other peoples? Youre nothing but a hack. Are you through cuz uh I gotta get back to work. Well Ill tell you what Ill do you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city. All right how about the next time your car breaks down you take *that* out of town. Fine. Good! Ow George! (crawls out from beneath the covers) What are you doing? (pops his head out of the covers looking a bit confused) Uh...you know uh...pleasuring you. Well stop it! You dont like the move? No. I dont. Youre kidding. No Im not. It feels like aliens poking at my body. Sorry. Ill just go back to my usual routine. Oh god! Oh god Dave! Oh yes! Yes! No Im sorry. What?!! I cant do the move. What? Oh hes ruined it for me. Oh oh come on please? No he called me a hack. Im just not into doing it anymore. Oh so---so thats it? Ill come up with some new stuff. Call me. Thirty-six twenty-four forty-six. I think I have what youre looking for. (Pleased by the note Kramer stumbles into his car). I must caution you about one thing. You cant cry for at least ten day. You can ruin the operation. Oh okay. Now is someone coming to pick you up? Yes my sons friend should be here any minute. Can I help you? Ah yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.

Did you close with the swirl? Supposed to close with the swirl? Oh my god. Yes you close with the swirl. Theres a progression there. I told you to write it down. Yeah yeah shouldve written it down. Yeah? Elaine. Cmon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Dont even do the move anymore. Youre gonna give it a bad name. Hello? Yeah this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! Thats the estimate on my car?!! No dont even do anything. Im gonna think about it. Okay bye. Whats to think about? If Putty says its what it is its what it is. Hes not gonna cheat you. Except that its not Putty. What happened to Putty? Eh we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.

Its like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*. Huh. I mean this move is no good Jerry. Its just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing! Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way? Yes. As a matter of fact there is. I think thats mine. Im not surprised. Listen. I need you to do me a favor. Whens the next time youre gonna see him? Why? You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me. An estimate? How am I supposed to do that? Well look. Heres the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order) (takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?

Well thats it. Im going back to Putty. No move is worth this. Oh! You mean you dont care if he does the move anymore? Are you kidding? He can do every move Ive ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You cant compare that to sex. Hi Mr. Constanza. Whats uh...? Wheres your friend Kramer? I dont know. Why? Because Im looking for him. Thats why. He stopped short. What do you mean? In a car with my wife. He stopped short. You think I dont know what thats about? Thats my old move! I used it on Estelle forty years ago! I told everybody about it! Everybody knows! (Demonstrates) Hmmph! I stopped short. Really stopping short. Thats a good move. Youre not kidding its a good move! Hey. Hey. Hey Frank. Dont Frank me!

Sorry for the delay folks there is a slight complication that were taking care of and then well be on our way to La Guardia... (To Katie) What is the complication? Mr. Seinfeld? Yes? Im sorry but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane. What? Apparently he has some sort of problem with you. Im not surprised. I really let him have it Jerry. He has no business being in your audience if you didnt want him there. I didnt care. Well now the pilot doesnt want you on his plane. He cant just throw me off the plane! Yes he can if he has cause to believe a passenger will be a disturbance. But Im not a disturbance! Well apparently you are disturbing him sir. But someone is waiting for me! Jerry I dont want you to freak out. Im freakin out! I am freakin out! Theres a flight leaving at eight and another one at eight-thirty which one do you want? Which one do you think I want?

(Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine) All right but you have to go now. I said Ill take care of it! Kramer. Hey. Okay here it is. Good. (To Earl) Heres my collateral. So its a mailbag so what? So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is? (Reading) David Berkowitz. Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced. Where did you get this? I took over his route. And boy were there a lot of dogs on that route. Any of em talk to you? Just to tell me to keep off the snacks! (To Kramer) Your buddys a helluva guy. Yeah dont I know it.

Oh we lost the road a half hour ago. What? Why didnt you wake me up? You told me not to bother you with minor details. No road is a major detail! Okay now I know. Should I keep going or turn around do you have a preference? (Pointing ahead) Look out! May I help you? Im the exterminator. Oh yes of course come in. Why didnt you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform? Yes well if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator they would just panic. Besides this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl right? Do I know you? Yeah sure we met at Jerry Seinfelds apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there. Seinfeld... Oh yeah funny white guy right? Jerry? Yes I suppose he is white. You know I never really thought about it. I dont see people in terms of color. You know theres someone Id like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in? Mr. Morgan left for dinner. He left... huh... Carl you hungry? Heres a new twist on car pooling: Early this morning a lost Manhattanite drove through a residential backyard and wound up in a swimming pool near Ithaca New York. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld a passenger seemed a little freaked out. Thats it! No more questions! I dont care! Thats him! Thats the man who gave me the pills in the drug store! Hes no pharmacist. Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier for Elaine. (She looks at Mr. Pitt) (To Carl) Oh by the way order anything you want its all on me. Just do me a tiny favor: pretend were old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence its Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine Carl. Im the exterminator.

Did you here about his plane in Ithaca? What about the plane in Ithaca? Oh our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that? Boy...

Mr. Pitt what are you delirious? Hes never even met you! Youre fired Elaine. Goodbye. Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt) Bridget! Jerry what happened? Oh Im so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together. Well my plane doesnt leave for another half hour. Really? (They start to make out Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God thats him! Thats the pilot! I love this place. You know Carl and I come here all the time. Is that right? Yeah I come here all the time. You wouldnt believe the rat problems in the kitchen. (George spits out food) I thought so. You really are an exterminator. This time George youve sunk to a new low. (He leaves) Check please. Hey Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house. Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!]
105,6,23,[Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? Its just paper on a cardboard roll thats it. And in ten thousand years it will still be exactly the same because really what else can they do? Thats true. There really has been no development in toilet paper. And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same and will be so until were dead. Yeah youre right George. What else can they do? Its just paper on a roll thats it. And thats all it will ever be. Wow.

Anyway Im thinking of making a big move. What? I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night then I just chickened out. Well thats a big move Georgie boy. Are you confident in the I love you return? Fifty-fifty. Cause if you dont get that return thats a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there. Aw Ive just got to say it once everybody else gets to say it why cant I say it? What you never said it? Once to a dog. He licked himself and left the room. Well so it wasnt a total loss. Hey.

Oh no no no if you must know I would rather be with her than go to the game. She must be a very special lady huh George yeah. Well what do I do with the extra ticket? Oh hey can I bring David Puddy? Hes a big Devils fan. Sure fine with me. Hey by the way if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo Siena works there as a trainer. So she works at the zoo? Yeah yeah. Yeah like Diane Fosse. You know shes the only person thats ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know once those gorillas accept you you got it made in the shade. So how long have you been a Devils fan? (off camera) Since I was a kid Im from Jersey. Yeah? Well were gonna kick your butts tonight. Hey no way man. Yes. Were primed. Alright you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second. What the-- So what do you think? What is that? I painted my face. (still in disbelief) You painted your face? Yeah. Why?

Yeah thats cool. Well you gotta support your team. Ok ready to go? Yeah. (startlingly loud) LETS GET IT ON!!! Alright!! Go Devils!! Go Devils!! Lets go Devils!! Youre dead Messier! Were gonna get you Messier! Hey man Im just trying to support the team. Will you sit down? Youre disturbing everybody. Sit down! Oh yeah because youre a Ranger fan and you know Im messing with their heads. Go Devils!! Devils goal! Stephan Richer scores from just inside the blue line! And the Devils take-- (George turns down the volume) You know I could have actually gone to that. So why didnt you? Well I didnt want to break our date. Oh well. Because I... I love you. You know Im hungry. Lets get something to eat. Ha ha! We took it to you! You couldnt get it out of your zone all night. We were aggressive we didnt let you penetrate! Alright thats enough out of you theres still three more games left in this series my friend and its far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy whos crossing the street) Watch out! (pounding the hood) Hey what are you doing?! Watch where youre driving man! (He approaches the passenger side window) Dont mess with the Devils buddy. Were number one we beat anybody! Were the Devils! The Devils!! Haaaa!!! El Diablo! Dios mio! El Diablo!! Im hungry. Lets get something to eat. Yup. Big matzoh ball. Huge matzoh ball. Those damn I love you returns. Well its all over. I slipped up. Oh you dont know. You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when theres an I love you out of the bag? You cant have a relationship where one person says I love you and the other says Im hungry. Lets get something to eat.. Unless youre married. I mean now she thinks that Im one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them. No people hate that. You want to be with somebody that doesnt like you. Ideally. I am never saying I love you again unless they say it first. Matzoh ball soup? Thatd be me. Hey Jerry? Youre a smart guy right? No question about it. Alright you know Im supposed to go on this special tour today with Georges girlfriend. At the zoo? Yeah but before I met up with her I stopped to look at the monkeys when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it. Kramer you threw a banana peel at a monkey? Well he started it! Its a monkey Kramer! Well he pushed my buttons I couldnt help it Jerry. Well I still think its wrong. Alright alright fine. You take the monkeys side alright go ahead. Im not taking anyones side. (walking out) Cause I know what happened Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets? No. Oh Jerry what are you waiting for? What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me how many time I gotta thank him? Oh no no no you gotta call him the next day its common courtesy. No I dont believe in it. Im taking a stand against all this over thanking. Jerry good manners are the glue of society. Hey if I knew I had to give him eight million thank yous I wouldnt have taken the tickets in the first place. Alright you know what this is gonna do? Hes gonna be upset because you didnt call him and were not gonna get those tickets for Friday night. Ah youre out of your mind. Alright where you going? I gotta get a suit cleaned I have a funeral on Friday. Who died? Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee? So he actually had it? No car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car. That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now hes gone completely loco. The one Puddy screamed at in the car? Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He wont leave his room in the church basement. Well thats what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter. I mean what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that? Gotta support the team. You know I really hate my clothes. Hm. I open up my closet theres just nothing. Hm. Nothing. I hate everything I have I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean at this point its like I can wear something three or four times and thats it. Hm. Its getting to be a terrible problem for me. (noticing Alec Berg walk in whispers) Hey Alec! Did you see that? What kind of a hello was that? Ah Mr. Kramer? Yes. Thanks for coming. So uh what did you want to see me about? Well Mr. Kramer to get right to it were having a bit of a problem with Barry. Barry? The chimpanzee. Oh. Well uh whats the problem? Well hes not functioning the way he normally does. He seems depressed. Hes lost his appetite. Hes even curtailed his autoerotic activities. And we think this is directly related to the altercation he had with you the other day. So so what do you want me to do? Well frankly wed like you to apologize. Yeah well he started it. Mr. Kramer he is an innocent primate. So am I. What about my feelings? Dont my feelings count for anything? Oh only the poor monkeys important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look Im sorry. I-- Hey thats ok. Well Ive gotta go feed the marmosets. (to Siena as shes walking out but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you. She doesnt hear too well out of her left ear. Oh. I mean do you think its possible that hes mad at me because he didnt get the day-after thank you? Wait a minute you were at a funeral right? Yeah. Well people never give a good hello at a funeral. I mean they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) Thats the biggest. Yeah yeah thats kinda what he gave me. Hey they cant go Hey! You look fabulous! Hey. Hey. Well I just spoke to your girlfriend. Girlfriend yeah right. Anyway she asked me to apologize to Barry. Barry? The monkey. Well? Nothing doing. Jerry I didnt do anything. Its the monkey that should be apologizing to me. Well I dont think thats gonna happen. Well Im sorry. Well George I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena but I dont think she heard me. You know left ear? What? Yeah her boss told me that she cant hear very well out of her left ear. What you didnt know that? Oh my god. What? She probably never heard it. Dont you see what this means? Its like the whole thing never happened. Its like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane! Are you gonna say it again? Thats the question Jimmy. Im gonna do it. What? After what you just went through I thought you said youd never say it again. Id like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it! Whats going on? Hes gonna talk into her other ear. Oh. Well listen I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now did you talk to Alec berg? Yeah I saw him. Alright so hes gonna give you the hockey tickets huh? Well not exactly. Hes mad isnt he? See I knew it. I dont know if hes mad. Alright so what happened when you saw him? Well I didnt really get a good hello but see I was at a funeral. Uh huh. See so I dont know if I got a funeral hello or he was mad because he didnt get his day-after thank you. See I told you Jerry I told you! Look what do you want me to do? I want you to get on this phone and give him his thank you! No. No I cant! Jerry this is the way society functions. Arent you a part of society? Because if you dont want to be a part of society Jerry why dont you just get in your car and move to the East Side! Look we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral hello. He knows were here he knows the number he knows we want to go. Theres plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets. You stubborn stupid silly man! Hey great dip. You made this? No its from the store. Oh. Hey how come people dont have dip for dinner? Why is it only a snack why cant it be a meal you know? I dont understand stuff like that. David? David I think we aught to talk. Alright thats cool. David I dont think we should see each other anymore. You gotta be kidding how come? Well you see David youre a face painter. Yeah thats right.

If she was sitting next to me Id put my arm around her. I cant be making a big move like going all the way over there. I cant. I wont. She calls me this morning and tells me shes upset I didnt console her. I mean it was Beaches for gods sake. What what do you do in a situation like that? Where were you? I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch. Well you know if you were sitting right next to her youd have to console her no matter what. Of course. When youre talking about a movie like Beaches moving from the chair to the couch  . . . thats quite a voyage. yeah Hey. Hey. I gotta go. Where you going? The Improv is playing Rochelle Rochelle The musical. Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there? She might be. Shes the star of the show. Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry dont tease me. I didnt know you were such a Bette Midler fan. So maybe Ill go down there and watch uh? Shell be there maybe. Gennice palying today? Yeah maybe. Whos Gennice? Thats the understudy. Im dating her. Oh uh is this uh Bette Midlers understudy? Yeah. Oh understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world. Im glad shes an understudy. I dont have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say. Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know thats a real problem. Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidnt like the show. I didnt like you. It just really stunk. The whole thing...real bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though. You late. I know I know. I didnt have change for the bus and they dont give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus Thats a shame. Youll have to wait for Lotus now. How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do. Mustnt keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry. No change for bus Poor princess. What? uh? Nothing wont be long. Princess wants a manicure. Oh lucky me. Oh you got the princess. What is so funny? ...tell knock-knock joke. The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog. How would you know? You dont speak Korean. Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at me...ge ge ge You know maybe in Korean dog isnt an insult. Could be like the word fox to us. Oh shes a DOG! Why dont you go to another nail shop? Because theyre the best Jerry the best. Look. Maybe Im just being paranoid. What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what theyre saying. Yeah who speaks Korean? You know who speaks Korean? No who? Georges father. You gotta be kidding me. How does he speak Korean? He used to go there a lot on business. What did he do? He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus the virgin Mary that were manufactured in Korea. Uh George does your father speak Korean? Yeah he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon. Oh hi Gennice. Hi Jerry. This is George this is Kramer. Nice to meet you. Playing today? No. Im on the bench today. They really stick to that understudy rule. So shes coming? Oh yeah shell be here. . . .(DROPS HOT DOG) Oh no my frankfurter my frankfurter fell (sob sob sob sob) .

(Leaves) Anyway Mr. Costanza what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean? I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus statues from me. Hes a hell of a nice guy. uh ha. Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie. Yeah yeah. Uh uh listen Mr. Costanza if uh if you do this for me Ill get you a manicure Ill pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want. No one is touching my feet. Between you and me Elaine I think Ive got a foot odour problem. I watched Beaches on cable last night. ...(wings?) ... Give me a break. Get some talent then you can mouth off. Strike three. What? Are you blind? What? Nothing nothing. I had an affair with a Korean woman. Uh Mr. Costanza I ... No I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me. Mr. Costanza I ... Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again the foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say  eno enoa juang . Which means this guy - this is not my kind of guy. Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on special today! Come on George just loosen up. Come on George. I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. : I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. (to George) Keep going. Aaaaaah SAFE! come on its just a game. (holding bette) Dont worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) You are the wind... the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical. . . . Thank you. (hugs Jerry and George) Well we... No please. This is the first time in my life (sobs) that anyone has ever done anything like this for me. Ive always had to struggle so hard for everything I ever got. (sobbing) and I know this is going to be my big break. (sobbing) (with no emotion) Its okay. Everything is going to be all right. Come on Jerry open up. I KNOW YOURE IN THERE! Come back another time. SO...youre all in here together. How convenient. I hope youre all proud of yourselves. So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman and Martin and Fontaine and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits) Hi everyone. Um this is my friend Frank. What would you like today? Manicure Pedicure? Ill take a manicure. I dont take my shoes off for anyone. Thats the least of his problems. What was that? Whatd they say? Whatd they say? They made a derogatory comment about me. Shes with a man twice her age. He doesnt look like hes got much money either. Check out that sweater. (all laughing) I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket. What happened to his tail? Okay THATS IT! oki on awa Wheres my tail? I heard every word you said. You got some nerve. That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight. That man also refuses to take his shoes off. (from other room) I never seen people treated like this! You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out! Frank? Kim? (on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw ... you want whit e meat or dark? White meat. Yeah white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. Its your ass buster. Get me one of those Black and White cookies. yeah all right yeah.... (hangs up) They dont have any. But dont worry Im going to get you one somewhere. Good. Because if I dont get a Black and White cookie Im not going to be very pleasant to be around. Now thats impossible. (sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella) ... I dont even know where Im going. Thats the best way to get someplace youve never been. yes (sob) I suppose ... Have you been crying? Yes (sob) you see this (sob) woman this manicurist... Oh no that doesnt matter now. Thats a very nice jacket. Uh (sob) thanks. Very soft huge button flaps cargo pockets draw string waist deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola. How do you know all that? Thats my coat. You mean..? Yes Im J. Peterman. Oh! I dont know why I have to go to the hospital. I didnt do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here were picking somebody up. Hey I didnt do anything. I was never informed. ... YOU CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL.... You see that? You see what I am going through? So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night. Hey Im being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy. Im having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever wanted to do is sing. Now Im the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) Nobody in the show will even talk to me. Stop your crying will ya? What? You heard him. Oh dont you youre the reason this whole thing happened. Oh yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You werent in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh? Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab. Hey I had nothing to do with it. Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in prison for the rest of your life. Get out each of you. Each and every one of you get out of my cab. Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as fast as I could.

Mens whole and half sizes 7 through 13. Price $135.00. Oh thats not too expensive. That shirt. Where did you get it? Oh this innocent looking shirt has something which isnt innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy silky Italian cotton with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket relaxed fit innocence and mayhem at once. Thats NOT bad! Oh Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off. I couldnt because I had a potential foot problem. I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks. I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I dont know why your father had to make a federal case out of it. Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of us. Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance on shoe removal. You short stop me? We dont do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever want to see you again. Hi here.

Well as a backup system in case the lock is broken you can see if its taken. A backup system? Were designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? Thats not a system. Thats a complete breakdown of the system. Can we change the subject please? Why? Whats wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject? No fine.

See now that I dont care for. Right. I mean were on a subject. Why does it have to be changed? It should resolve of its own volition. Thats exactly what I said except I used the word momentum. Momentum - same thing. Same thing. My god Im getting married in December do you know that? Yeah I know. Well I dont see how Im gonna make December. I mean I need a little more time.

You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldnt turn you in. Is that so? Hey Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in? Definitely. Youre kidding? No no I would turn you in. You would turn me in? Phwap I wouldnt even think about it. I cant believe your a friend of mine. What kind of person are you going around killing people? Well I am sure I had a good reason. Well if youll kill this person whos to say I wouldnt be next? But you know me! I thought I DID! Im not a very religious person but I do feel as if Im in need of some guidance here. Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway um this friend of mine George got engaged . How wonderful. Yeah yeah well for some reason um I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment. Doesnt it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions? No no no it doesnt. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick. You know Elaine very often we cannot see the forest for the trees. Yeah I dont know what that means. Well for example say theres a forest . . . You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know Im smart. Im attractive. You know my temple has many single functions. No no its okay. My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps ... I dont think so. He owns a flower store. Very successful. So youre nothing but a stoolie. Admit it. Hey dont do the crime if you cant do the time. Another Caf&eacute; Latte? You better believe it. Since when are you so trendy? Hey baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf&eacute; Latte? I dont recall you drinking Caf&eacute; Latte. Ive been drinking Caf&eacute; Latte since the fifth grade and I havent looked back. Hey Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only. Ive always wanted to see this. You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it. Well yeah lets do it uh? Look at this Jerry dropping paper on the ground. Thats littering. Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in. Maybe I will. Hi How was your day? Good good day. How was your day? Mine was okay. So whats goin on? Oh nothin much. I went over to jerrys uh talked to Jerry. Oh the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night. The Lowers really? You dont want to go? No I want to go. So what did Jerry have to say? Oh nothin much . . . talkin. . . . Oh oh oh did I have an unbelievable idea today! Oh yeah the toilets. You told me. Yeah ha ha Its not the toilets its not the toilets. Its something else. Are you ready for this? Yeah. Okay how about this? All right we get married March 21st the first day of Spring. What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding? No no no its not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the ... If you dont want to marry me George just say so. (crying) Say so. Still marry  still marry. You dont love me. Sstill love. Still love. My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake. No no no no mistake no mistake. No no  listen were going to get married over Christmas I ...It doesnt make any difference to me. Its fine. Really. Are you sure? Yeah yeah sure Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff. Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved. How did you know that? I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath. I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself. tes its very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. Thats why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity. You see those tears streaming down you dont know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out. Well at least you probably had some uh pretty good make-up sex after. I didnt have any sex. You didnt have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean thats the best feature of the heavy relationship. I didnt have make-up sex. In your situation the only sex youre going to have better than make-up sex is if youre dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit. Yeah conjugal visit sex. That is happening! (crying) I can tell youre very upset but Im sorry Im not goin Did you here that? I cant believe this hes eating his sandwich. Are you going to eat thoise fries? This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shakes mans hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . Im going back in! . . . Youll feel better (to woman) . . . Poor bastard. Good evening Rabbi. Good evening. And how does this evening find you? Well Rabbi well. I trust you are here to see your friend Elaine. Yeah thats right. I hope shes feeling better. What do you mean? She didnt tell you? No. Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile. is that so? Yes in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married. Really? She came off as pretty desperate. I didnt know any of this. Apparently she doesnt think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation. Hum well it all comes as news to me. (enters) Hi. Hi how was your day? Good good day. How was your day? Ah it was okay. Whats going on? Oh nothing much. You know I went over to Jerrys. Talked to Jerry. Um could I talk to you for a minute? Yeah sure. You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble cry mumble . . . Im scared. You and I together (cry) George of course of course it can wait until march if that is what you want. Yeah? Oh dont worry your head. Of course. All right. (smiles behind her back) Ive got that magazine article for you. You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside. Are you Understand you had a little talk with him too. Yeah talked earlier. Yes I know I know. Nothing nothing. He didnt mention . . . Yes he did. He told you about our conversation? We had quite a little chat. He told you about . . . Yes about how youre very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him. He told you all that? How could he? It didnt take much prodding either I must say. Can he do that? He did it. But hes a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth? Thats whats so fascinating. You better finish your little caf&eacute; latte there. They wont let you in with it. Why not? Because they dont allow outside drinks into the movie. Well thats stupid Thats the rule. Well well just see if we cant get around that. Oh Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again. Yeah... Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas? No no. Listen Rabbi Id like to ask you a question. Why why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about? Was that a problem for you? Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didnt you didnt tell anyone else about this did you? Well lets see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F. Mrs. Winston? Yes we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going to happen for you. What about Don Ramsey? You didnt mention anything to him did you? Don Ramsey? You know that tall really good looking guy he lives on the fifth floor. Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him... my god you didnt. Excuse me pardon me excuse me Oh yow oow Ah! Hey hey whats going on? What just happened here? Nothing Nothing. Whatya got? One of those Caf&eacute; Lattes in your shirt? I dont have anything. Ask him. All right come on Coffee Boy bring it out. What?! Here you go. Ow But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod. Elaine if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves. You didnt say this to George did you? No . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment hostility? Yeah that! So . . . Hey oh. GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh my god. I havent seen you since it happened. Im so happy for you. Alright thanks a lot. Oh come on. You really really deserve it. Oh deserve! I dont know if I deserve...I mean... Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man you have grown. Youve matured. Well I guess Im getting older. Oh! Well I just think its wonderful. Honestly! Ive gotta run but um please please give my best to Susan. Yeah. My most just heartfelt congratulations. Yeah. Thanks. Hey listen if you ever get a date maybe the four of us could go out together sometime. Yes! Yes yes. Sure. Wait as a matter of fact wasnt there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something. Yes. Yes yes. Yes. Yeah! Boy she is something isnt she? Yeah shes something else. Hey so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh... Nope. I wept like a baby. What? Well I started to tell her and then all of the sudden for some reason I just burst into tears. You cried? I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And Ill tell you Jerry it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to. Hey! Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around. Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer were suing for millions. Suing? What for? The coffee was too hot. Its supposed to be hot. Not THAT hot. (On TV) The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless. Wait. Whoa! Thats the Rabbi from Elaines building. I just met this guy the other day. A young lady I know lets call her Elaine happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend lets call him George. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while youre engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was theyre never going to see each other again so whats the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now Id like to close with a psalm.]
109,7,3,[And then I hear this rabbi on television I mean imagine. Im really sorry George I I I wasnt jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing. Ya know I was just a little surprised. Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that? What about all the loser stuff? I dont know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said Ive never seen you looser. I can see the can if youre in the army but fresh fruit its available its there its 2 aisles over. (Gets up to leave) Well scintillating as always. Where you going? Im going shopping with Susan. What kind of shopping? Clothes shopping. Where are you going? Ross. Oh thats a nice store. Yeah its her uncles. Discount? (As he leaves) One would hope. So ya know my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte. (Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee? Yeah thats right. Half milk half coffee? Yeah. Hm Hm. You take a sip? Yes I did. Now when you took a sip did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip it in your normal fashion? No I wasnt able to sip it in my normal fashion. Hm Hm. All right all right. You take big sips? Well I think I take a normal sip. O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened? Well you know ahh they dont allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in. Yeah see they like to sell their own coffee. Yeah now is that going to be a problem? Yeah thats going to be a problem. Its gonna be a problem for them. This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. Its an infringement on your constitutional rights. Its outrageous egregious preposterous. Its definitely preposterous. So. Then what happened? Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me. Was there a top on it? Yeah. Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you? No. They put the top on. And they made the top. You didnt make the top did you? (To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World. Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) Were gonna run some test on that top. Have you been to the doctor? Ah No no I havent. (To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him its from me. So ah what do you think Mr. Chiles. Jackie. Jackie. I mean we have a chance? Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury you gonna walk outta there a rich man. I dont like it its red. It its too flashy. Well you could use a little flash. All right. Dont change me. Susan. Dont change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now. Name one. So you find anything? Oh hes impossible to shop for uncle Ned. Im going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe Ill see you in a couple of weeks. O.K. Excuse me Mr Ross. See now this I dont get. What? The security guard. What about him? Why does he have to stand? Because hes a security guard. But I mean look at him. Hes gotta be on his feet like that all day? Thats brutal. I think Im gonna say something to your uncle. George you just met him. Dont say anything to him. Arent you concerned about the security guard? Not really. (Walks away) (Thinking to himself) Shes not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? Im marrying a person who doesnt care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting. All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you think? So ah what did you do last night? Nothing. I know nothing but what did you actually do? Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared. Wow. That really is nothing. I told ya. Hey. Hey. Hey. What are you all dressed up for? Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer. Oh yeah hows that looking? Oh Ill tell you how its looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury (in a very high voice) Im gonna be a rich man. Thats despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? Im a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldnt give you a nickel Kramer. Yeah well you wouldnt be on that jury. He would have weeded you out. Frankly Im surprised youre so litigious. Oh I can be quite litigious. What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot. Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty. (Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty. Hey Maestro! Ah Kramer. Im in here. Hows it going. Fine. Hi Bob. (Apologetically) Oh Im sorry. Maestro. Well this is a surprise ha? I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. Its supposed to be great stuff. Its all herbal. Oh Maestro you what are you doing? You dont have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro? Its nothing. Yeah ya know you havent been around for a while. Oh yeah Ive been at my house in Tuscany. Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? Thats in Italy. I hear its ah beautiful there. Well if youre thinking of getting a place there dont bother. Theres really nothing available. (Surprised) Huh? (Seeing Elaine) Oh! Hello. Well Hello. And who might you be? I might be Elaine. This is a Bob Cobb. Maestro. Oh Maestro. It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaines hand) Enchante. Well I have to be going. Jinx buy me a coke. Oh. Love it when that happeneds. I know I know. That is so ahh ...... Coincidental. Yeah thanks. O.K. Bye you guys. Ciao. Yeah yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah. You know you hurt the Maestros feelings. Oh what because I didnt call him Maestro? Thats right. Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro. Why? Because its a stupid thing to be called. Jerry hes a conductor. Oh conductor. He conducts the Policemans Benevolent Association Orchestra. Well hes still a conductor. Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine. Oh you should see him do Flight of the Bumble Bee. New shirt? Yeah. You like it. No not particularly. Why the color? Yeah. Too flashy? Yeah its burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right? (Obviously lying) No. (Reaches for a menu) All right whats it going to be here. Let me ask you something. When you go into a store does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day? No. See didnt bother Susan either. Thats why Im different. I can sense the slightest human suffering. Are you sensing anything right now? Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldnt he have a chair? Well what about criminal activity? Hes got to be alert. What he cant jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. Im up. (pretends hes shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It! Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down. Would you get out of here. Whos gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe Ill have a talk with him. I know you will. Hey hey hey listen to this. Jackie just called. Who? His lawyer. Yeah Java World wants to settle. What? Yeah Im gonna be rich. Why are they settling? Cause their afraid of bad publicity. All this because you spilled coffee on yourself? Yeah thats right. (Very loud in the direction of a waiter) Im gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling! And then about four years ago I was on holiday in Tuscany. Uh ha. And I fell in love with this house. Are you ready to order? Oh God. What are you getting Bob? Good question. (to waiter) Well need a few minutes. You know Im sorry but I didnt mention it earlier but actually I preferred to be called Maestro. Excuse me? Well ya know I am a conductor. Yeah so? Oh I suppose its O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I dont. Well I mean dont you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny. I happen to know for a fact that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said Hello Maestro how about a beer. O.K. So thats a fact. Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing) Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area). What do you mean? Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look it healed it. So? So? My lawsuit. Im finished. I thought they wanted to settle. Well what happens if they want to see it? Then youre in a lot of trouble. Yeah!! (To guard) Tired? No. How come uh no chair? What? I I couldnt help but notice that uh you dont have a chair. I dont need a chair. No I didnt mean to imply that you did. Youre obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering have they ever offered you a chair? Nope. Would you like a chair? I suppose if they gave me one Id sit down. Ah ha Ah ha. You would wouldnt you? Obviously Id rather sit than stand if thats what your asking. Thats exactly my point. Well who wouldnt? Cause I tell you frankly I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy. You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didnt tell you to put the balm on. Whyd you put the balm on? You havent even been to see the doctor. If your gonna put a balm on let a doctor put a balm on. I guess I screwed up huh Jackie? Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway? The Maestro. The who? What are you talking about Maestro? My friend hes a conductor. Oh oh oh so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it? Well my stomach was burning. I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation. Well I didnt know the balm was gonna work. Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didnt you read the instructions? Well I ... (interrupts) No one can tell what a balms gonna do. Theyre unpredictable. Im sorry Jackie. (To cab driver) Pull over here driver this is it. (Motions with his head) Yeah get over. Did you have a good time? Yeah hes very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing The Requiem. (Sarcastically) Yeah everyone knows that it was in Amadeus. Really? So what about the Maestro stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro. Yeah I called him Maestro. You didnt mind? Well I did at first but actually I kind of got used to it. O.K. from now on I want you to call me Jerry the Great. I am not calling you Jerry the Great. Why not you call him Maestro. He is a Maestro. Well Im great. So you say. What about his house in Tuscany he mention that? Yeah. (bragging) Im invited. You know when I told him it was beautiful there out of the clear blue sky he says theres nothing to rent. As if he doesnt want anyone else there. Why? I dont know. Maybe hes embarrassed by Americans. Yeah well maybe there arent any houses to rent there. In all of Tuscany? I wonder. I say we offer him $50000 thats it take it or leave it. How do we know how severe the burns are? Why dont we have him examined by a doctor. Listen the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into the paper it will kill us. All right well start at 50000 and free coffee at all of our stores. (Answering secretary) Yes? Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here. Send them in. Gentleman. Gentleman come in. Now we dont want to take up much of your time. Lets make this short and sweet. Were prepared to offer you all the free coffee you want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe Plus.. (Interrupting) ILL TAKE IT!! Ill take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it? No. I know the Maestro didnt tell you to take it he wasnt there. Well I thought we were lucky to get anything. Free coffee? Yeah. I dont want free coffee. Its not hard to get coffee. I can get my own Well I didnt hear any Plus. 20 years practicing law Ive never experienced anything like this. Look Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen Im gonna get out here. Im gonna get myself a free cafe latte. Hey. Hi Maestro. Beethovens 7th. Yeah. Hey you know we were just talking about you. Oh yeah? Yeah ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany? You didnt find one did you? No. Im not really looking. Nor should you. So are you telling me theres not one house to rent in all of Tuscany? The houses are passed down from generation to generation its very hard. I cant get a sublet a guest room a cot nothing? Its booked solid! Its BOOKED Jerry! Howd you get yours? Got lucky. Come on Elaine lets take a ride I was about to pop in some Verdi. Maybe Ill check out France. Hey George do you believe this guy? Who? Bob Cobb. Bob Cobb? You know the Maestro. Oh I missed the Maestro? Yeah get this he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent. Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany? No. So what do you care? I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany. Of course he is. Theres got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is? I have no idea. It its huge. Its probably like North Dakota. Oh no way its that big. Its a big region. Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid? I dont know why I bother even talking to you. Hey no ones got a gun to your head. All right. So I spoke to the security guard. Yeah and? Well its tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair hed sit. So are you gonna get him a chair? Yup. Its really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool. Yeah that would give him some height be able to check things out. With a back or without. Oh I think Id go for the back. Swivel? I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those directors chairs. What do you think of those. I thinks its kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect. You mean one of those vinyl things? Yes. Vinyl yeah maybe. How can I figure out if theres any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppys from Tuscany. Im gonna go call him. Yeah good luck. Hey Ill meet you outside. Poppy told me to talk to his cousin he lives down in Little Italy. What do you think about a rocking chair? (Speaking very fast and fidgety) You cant put a limit on my cafe lattes it says so right here. And I dont want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems Im gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble. Hey hey hey slow down Eddie. What whats the matter? Awe there making faces at me cause Ive had a couple of cafe lattes. But Im entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want that was the settlement. Thats it?

I think Id rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether youd rather date the blind or the deaf. Ah . . . Now youre off on a topic. You know I think I would rather date the deaf. Uh hu. Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it theyre not going to get all the crumbs. Id possibly be walking around with a sponge. You see I disagree. Id rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesnt even know youre not good enough for her. I think shed figure it out. What? What is this? Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit. Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?

Elaine what percentage of people would you say are good looking? Twenty-five percent. Twenty-five percent you say? No way! Its like 4 to 6 percent. Its a twenty to one shot. Youre way off. Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? Its like a leper colony down there. So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable? UNDATEABLE! Then how are all these people getting together? Alcohol. (to George who is winking) What is your problem? No problem here. You keep winking at me. Thats really obnoxious. I had no idea. Right there. Right there. You just did it again. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Its from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me. Youre eye still hurts? Yeah yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too. Pulp couldnt make it across the table. Pulp can move Baby! Why didnt you eat a real breakfast? Hey I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye thats the breaks. Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. Thats why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso. What did he think you were flirtin with him? Hu oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan. Hi guys. Hi Hello Archie Veronica Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matinglys signature? Yeah. And Buck Showalters? Its an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office. Um can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs. Yeah like Im going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks) No of course not. (winks back) You know you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318 where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter. I dont know. An envelope doesnt really cut it. Why? What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something. Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan? Hello. Oh by the way have you got that birthday card? Birthday card? Mr. Steinbrenners birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for me to sign. Oh ah I uh will have that for you by after lunch. Fine. Ill be back after my massage. Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks) Hello. James! Ah ha Hello! Phew! I cant believe youve never taken anybody here before. Well Im not really that much of a meat eater. . . . You dont eat meat? Are you one of those. . . Well no Im not one of those. When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here. Grandma Memma? Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma. No I think I would have remembered Memma. Oh well thats typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma. Ready? Ill have the porterhouse medium rare baked potato with sour cream What do you recommend besides the steak? The lamb chops are good. Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken? Its a full bird. Stuffed with ham topped with gorganzola. You know what? I think Ill just have the salad. . . . Thank you. (minds voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad? Hey you hey you. Oh uh ha youve got dogs? Yeah you know when you live alone youre dogs are all you have. Do you like dogs? (minds voice from - ... ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT ! Dogs. Oh I love dogs. Boys this is Elaine. . . . Sorry theyre usually very friendly. Hey! Hey Mr. Morgan how was your massage? I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage. Really? Yeah we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch. Hey listen dont oversleep. You cant afford to be late again. I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off. Geez Hey you know something you should try my friends wake up service. She swears by this thing. Costanza you may be my only friend around here. By the way you got that birthday card? Ah not yet. Just make sure Steinbrenner doesnt get it until I sign it. Yes sir! I just dont understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me. Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly? Huh huh. Did she mention anything about our lunch? Uh kind of. What do you mean kind of.? I mean she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man. What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women dont respect salad eaters. You got that right. But youre going over there for dinner tonight right? Um uh. What is she making? I dont know. But Im sure it had . . . parents. Call her up. She wont mind if you come. Oh dont worry. Ill be there and Ill be packing an artery. Ah Mr. Weatherbee. You got the Yankee envelope? Sure do. oh Here you go. Hey he Youll be pleased to see whats inside. What is this? Youre cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside. Who told you to sell the card? You did. No I didnt! No not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks) I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. Its like acid. I need that card back. Its Mr. Steinbrenners. I was responsible. Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy whos kids in the hospital . Well get it back! Its very important. (winks) Look do you want me to get it back or not? (holds eyes wide open) Get it back! Such a lovely table setting. Oh wear did you get these napkins? Theyre grandma Memmas. Oh I dont remember them. Oh you wouldnt. She only used them on special occasions. Special occassions? It wasnt special when my family visited? Everybody like mutton? Um mutton! Hope you didnt cut the fat off. That you Bobby? huh Well I heard that you have a very uh special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it. Sure do. Mister. Oh thats it yeah. Boy Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah well Bobby uh what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back. Oh no. Id never part with this card for anything in the world. Well uh Bobby uh whos your favorite Yankee. Paul ONeill. All right. What if I tell Paul ONeill to hit a home run tomorrow just for you. Would he? Paul ONeill would do that? For you he would. Would he hit two home runs? Two? Sure kid yeah. But then you gotta promise youll do something for me. I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again. Yeah that would be nice. But I really just need this card. What about this candelabra? Yeah that was grandma Memmas also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry Im thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad. Hey salads got nothin on this mutton. That is so funny. Did you just make that up? I wish I could take credit for it. Its actually the line my butcher uses when were chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket) That was in Grandmas study. What did you do ransack the place after she died? This is some FINE mutton. Im getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket? Uh well uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back) Its cold out and I didnt bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton. Down boy nice doggy . Im a nice person. Dont believe what you hear. Where are the napkins? What? Grandma Memmas napkins. Theres two missing. Elaine took them didnt she? I dont know about that. Have you got any floss? You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. Shes probably having a good laugh about it right now. Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a Elaine what are you doing in this neighborhood? Did you do with the dogs? Yeah theyre in the kitchen. . . . okay quite! Whats going on? These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here. Why were dogs chasing you? They just dont like me. Its a long story. I can tell you one day but I cant tell you right now. I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and its where I sleep. Well have to sleep head to toe. Head to toe? Head to toe. Hey wake up. Its 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15. Im sorry I didnt get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face. Youre a wake up guy. Dont you have calls to make? Ill make them later. Uh. Have you seen Morgan? Hes not here? No Hes late. Its impossible. I got him a wake up service. Now George you dont have to cover for him any more. Hes going to be gone soon and Im going to recommend you for his job. . . . gone? It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion. I dont want Morgans job. Hes got a lot of work to do. Hey Elaine your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan. Nah he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins. Napkins? I mean why? Why would I take her stupid napkins. Because they were in the pockets of my jacket. They were? Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton. Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton. What exactly is mutton? I dont know and I didnt want to find out. So where is my jacket? Oh I must have left it at James You spent the night at Jamess? Did we? Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business. Reversed positions? Yeah you know head to toe. So what your genitals are still lined up. No because I slept with my back to him. Mr. ONeill? Yeah. Yeah uh look you dont know me. I can give you an autograph there but my pens kind of screwed up. Youd only like half a P or something. No its uh not that see. Its about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits. Sure I could help you there. Sure well I promised you would hit him two home runs. Say what? You know Klick!. A couple of dingers. You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs? Yeah well no good? Yeah. Thats no good. Its terrible. You dont hit home runs like that. Its hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from? Two is better than one. That thats ridiculous. Im not a home run hitter. Well Babe Ruth did it. He did not. Oh do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar? Im not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two. Well maybe I did overextend myself. How the heck did you get in here anyway? (on phone) Oh hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 6:30 clients because of you. . . . Yeah well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas! The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon. Its hot in here. Hey Bobby can I have some of your juice? After Paul ONeill hits his first home run. (from buzzer) Its Holly. Yeah. Come on up. And the two and one pitch to ONeill. A towering shot back to deep right field and its gone. Yeah. A home run for Paul ONeill. The Yanks lead one nothing. OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT! One more to go. Hey. Whats all this? I decided I was going to make you dinner. I thought we were going out. Well after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you. Franco? Your butcher down the street. I bet he acted aloof like he didnt know me. A little. That is so Franco. Bottom of the eighth score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul ONeill. You know Bobby its very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul ONeill. He can do it Mr. Kramer. I know he can. Hell do it for me. Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bells head . . . ONeills rounding second ONeill going for third ONeill rounding . . . Come on Come on! . . . third being waived in. GO! GO!! . . . Martinez throws it over Alomars head. ONeill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead. An In The Park Home Run! Yeay! All Right! Yeah well I guess Ill be on my way (grabs framed card) Thats being scored a triple for Paul ONeill with a throwing error charged to Martinez. Hey ... Huh? ... thats not a home run. (grabs frame) Yeah maybe not technically but ... You said hed hit two home runs. Oh come on. Bobby Bobby! Thats just as good! Well youre not taking that card. Now Bobby Bobby we had a deal . . . gimme that ... So is the chop the way you like it? I usually like mine with an angioplasty. You know something really stinks to high h... Holly! What are you doing here? What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops. Im uh Im meeting James here. Hes bringing over your jacket. What about the napkins? I didnt take your napkins. Then who did? Ask Jerry. We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in todays modern world it just doesnt seem relevant. I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now Morgan did you ever sign it? No sir George never gave it to me. No thats right I didnt. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I uh . . . Hi Whats this? Oh its a birthday card. (to George) Oh by the way tomorrow night Paull ONeill has to catch a fly ball in his hat. George this is beautiful. Why didnt you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this? And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope. Ha ha ha ha ha George keep up the good work. Ha ha uh well you screwed me again Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when its already under glass? Uh this is... Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing? Oh bandanas arent they cute? You gave Memmas napkins to some dogs?! Hey what happened to my jacket? Oh the dogs did that but it wasnt their fault somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket. Was it mutton? Could have been. Do you always stuff meat in your pocket? Uh sometimes I use the sofa. You wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner? Yes George please come in come in. Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing. Oh no not just me the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan. Morgan Morgan you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it. Oh no Morgan is a good man sir. You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations you got his job. Wa uh thank you sir you know I am not quite sure Im right for it. Stop it George hes out youre in. A lot more work you know. I know. A lot more responsibility. Long long hours. I know. Not much more money. But youll finally get the recognition you deserve. Thats what Im afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner . . . You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra Lou Pinella Bucky Dent Billy Martin Dallas Green Dick Houser Bill Virdon Billy Martin Scott Marrow Billy Martin Bob Lemmon Billy Martin Gene Michael Buck Showalter ... uh tut! . . .George you didnt hear that from me. (George exits) . . . George!]
111,7,5,[(to Elaine) I cant believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one: I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later lost in the fiord a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest. This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country. Yeah. What do you do all day? Not that much. uh-uh. I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work. Yeah when the season starts. Right now I sit around pretending that Im busy. How do you pull that off? I always look annoyed. Yeah when you look annoyed all the time people think that youre busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds). Yeah you do! He looks very busy! Yeah he looks busy! Yeah! I know what Im doin. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves) (laughs) So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet? No. Im completely blocked! In fact Im gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh I cant! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight. What marathon runner? You know this guy Jean-Paul Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant editing a book on running... Oh wait! Jean-Paul Jean-Paul! Isnt he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?! Yeah thats him. Hes from uh...Trinidad and Tobago right? Yeah hes Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs) How do you oversleep at the Olympics...? Ah I know. I know...! I mean its like the biggest event of your life! Youd think youd have like 6 alarm clocks payin-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door... Yeah well he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years. Ah...thats a big responsability on your hands. What responsibility? I dont have any responsibility. You gotta wake him up! Eh...hell get up... Hi Judy. Hi Elaine. How are you? Fine. (laughs) Ive seen her in your building. Yeah. I didnt know she was married. (whispering) Shes not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Dont say anything to anybody. Whom I gonna tell? I know its just something you have to say... George we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items but I dont think theres gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very annoyed George) Ill let you get back to work George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office) He overslept and missed the whole race. Isnt that amazing? Ill tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up. My moneys on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock. Alarm clocks? I never use em. Dont trust em. What do you do? I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - pop!) ...I get up! Always works? It never fails. See its based on your body clock. See your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is. uh-uh. Whats with the bucket? Lomez he sold me his hot tub. Hot tub? Yeah yeah its in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket) You put a hot tub... in your living room? Oh its a beauty! Its got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating soothing your every aching muscle. The waters gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy) Is that tolerable? Oh...its tolerable...! (happy) Isnt that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you? Oh I think its a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves) He uh...doesnt have any running water? I dont ask those kind of questions anymore. Jerry. Jerry this is Jean-Paul. Ah hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sorry about the Olympics. Me too. (disappointed) Listen listen Im gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I cant...come up with anything for this thing. Ah...catalog writers block? Yeah thats funny. (annoyed) (pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm wasnt it? Man it wasnt the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze but no no snooze. AM/PM. Man it wasnt the AM/PM. It was the volume. Ah...the volume. Yes the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm. Ah separate knob. Yes separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated) Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio. Oh please man please! Dont worry its not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it. Elaine whats the alarm clock situation in your house? Jerry... Its a simple question... Ive got an alarm ok? That old one? Didnt I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock? Flight to Cleveland? It works. Elaine... It... works! Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in) George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously. Well...Ive got a lot to do! George Ill tell you what Id like you to do. I Id like you to drop everything.

Youre 40 minutes late. What happened? I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up? No. What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem? Well you said you were gonna be here at a certain time and you werent. uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what? Well means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race hes put his faith in you and frankly Im a little concerned! Oh are you?! Yes I am. Hey Im not running in the marathon! He is! Yeah I know that! Yeah I got enough to think about just tryin to come up with some load ocrap for that Himalayan walking shoe!

Youll be comfortable youll be near the starting line and most importantly... youll have a wake-up call Jean-Paul! A wake-up call! Wake-up call... These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long just waitin to make that call! (George comes in) No I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude. Hey you bastards. Hey how was the meeting?

Rating personnel till they cried calling managers on the field during a game threatening to move the team to New Jersey just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax.

Wheres my armoire? Well b -- it was stolen. Wha--? These street toughs they robbed me. Street toughs took my armoire? Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger.

You better decide sister. Youre on deck. Sheila! Uh-oh. Hey what is this? Youre kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line! I can kiss anywhere I want to. You just cost yourself a soup! How dare you? Come on Jerry were leaving. Jerry? Do I know you? So essentially you chose soup over a woman? It was a bisque. Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly George has become much more normal than you. Really? Yeah. Come on. I mean think about it. Hes engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup. Have you tastes the soup? Yeah. All right. You made the right decision. See the way I figure it its much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi. Hey. Yeah. Hey. Yeah. Oh thanks. There he is. Elaine Im really sorry about the armoire. Yeah. I know. Me too. So did these thieves want any money? No. They just wanted the armoire? Yeah. They were..quite taken with it. Yeah? Hup! Hup! Hey have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately? No. In what way? I dont know. A lot of attitude like hes better than me or something. I dont think George has ever thought hes better than anybody. Hello. Hello. Hey. Hello. Hello. Were you just talking about me? Whats going on? Absolutely not. Somethings going on here. All right [claps hands] Im gonna go get some soup. One of these days that guy is gonna get his. So how was the movie? Aw we didnt go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs. Oh yeah? Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you happy? Happy? Why should I be happy? I dont know but you look like youre happy. Why should I care? You cant fool me. Dont insult me George because I know when youre happy. All right. I am happy and Ill tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right Elaine? Is that so? Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy shmoopy out in public like that. Its disgusting! Disgusting? People who do that should be arrested. Well I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her. Ye - yeah. And we had a pact you know. What? You shook my hand in that coffee shop. Youre still with the pact? Mmm-hmm. You reneged. All I did was shake your hand. Ah-ha! And then they just ran off with the armoire just like that. Ohh! This city. One large jambalaya please. So continue. Well my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know shes very emotional. Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya! All right now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up youre welcome to it. So take it its yours. How can I possibly thank you? You are the only one who understands me. You suffer for your soup. Yes. That is right. You demand perfection from yourself from your soup. How can I tolerate any less from my customer? Uh gazpacho por favor. Por favor? Um Im part Spanish. Adios muchacho! Git. It was stupid of me. Well it was very insulting. No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding. Well behind every joke theres some truth. What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? Theres no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they dont have it he says  Aw Ill just have some coffee. Theres no truth to that. Well I guess youre right. So am I forgiven shmoopy? Yes shmoopy. Aw! Hey Jerry! Oh hi Susan George. You remember Sheila. Oh yes. Hello. Hello. Wont you join us? No thanks. Of course. Yes. Well -- So uh sit on the same side at a booth huh? Yeah. Thats right. You got a problem? I uh just think its a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty. Well were changing the rules. Ahh. Good for you. Aw what are you getting George? I dont know honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay sweetie? Oh George youre so sweet. Well I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie. Aww! What about you shmoopy? How bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy? Yeah. Yum yum little tuna fishy? Come here. And..voila! [gasps] Yeah. Oh! Oh I love it! I absolutely love it! Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it? The K Man did it! Yeah! [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing? How bout zero? What? Yeah. What? Whos was it? Whered you get it? Ill tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi. Get out! The Soup Nazi gave it to you? Yeah. Why? Well I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. Hes a wonderful man. [gasps] Yeah. Well a little bit misunderstood but uh.... Well Im just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful! Yeah. Well hes a dear. How much tip do you leave on $8.15? You know sweetie I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that youre not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship. Huh? [in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki dont you? How is he today? I think hes in a good mood. Hi. You know Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. Im mean I just cant tell you how much I appreciate it. You? If I knew it was for you I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now who wants soup? Next! Speak up! Im heading over to Elaines. Oh. Jerry those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire. Those two? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. Thats them. Well lets confront em. No. No. No. No. Lets get a cop. Theres no cops around. Theyre gonna leave. Come on. No! Lets go. Oh wow look that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one. Oh not in blue. Blue does not go with all. Oh please. Do you know what youre talking about? Because I dont think you know what youre talking about. Take a look at that. Excuse me. Are you talking to me? Uh well uh we -- I said are you talking to me? Well maybe he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?! Well wha -- I uh -- uh we were kind of uh talking to each other werent we? I mean you know Ive never been so insulted in my entire life. Theres something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that? I dont know.  5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms half a cup of olive oil 3 pounds of celery chopped parsley... Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes! So? So? So his secrets out. Dont you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city. Wait a second Elaine. Where do you think youre going? What do you care? Elaine I dont want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup. Get out of my way Jerry. Elaine let the man make his soup! Dont make me hurt you Jerry. Look they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby bluey? Oh yes. I - Im your baby bluey. Well. Well. Hi Jerry. Hey Susan George. You know I really like Sheila a lot. Oh really? Mmm-hmm. Because were kind of not seeing each other anymore. Oh no! Thats too bad. Yeah. Well she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally we couldnt quite make the connection. Really? Yeah. Too bad cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think its great that youre so open with your affections in public. See we had that. Mmm-hmm. You did? Oh yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. Ill see ya. Yeah. See ya. Go on! Leave! Get out! But I didnt do anything. Next! Hello. You. You think you can get soup? Please. Youre wasting everyones time. I dont want soup. I can make my own soup.  5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms half a cup of olive oil 3 pounds celery. That is my recipe for wild mushroom. Yeah thats right. I got em all. Cold cucumber corn and crab chowder mulligatawny. Mulliga...tawny? Youre through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! [panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! What is it? Somethings happened with the Soup Nazi! Wha - wha - whats the matter? Elaines down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says shes gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out hes not gonna make anymore soup! Hes moving out of the country moving to Argentina! No more soup Jerry! No more for of us! Well where are you going? Hes giving away whats left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!]

Hey sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin. (To Elaine) Uh did you get any of those sponges? Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why? Well...Susan. Ah Susan uses the sponge. Susan loves the sponge. Yeah Im sorry George. I cant help you out. What? I cant do it. No way theres no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.) Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See this is not just a weekend routine...Im on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex? Oh yeah I know all about make-up sex and Im really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.) Elaine can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many many times now and just between you and me theres really no big surprises here so...make-up sex is all that I have left. Im sure youll have another fight George. (Stamps on Georges foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought! So listen to this. But dont tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He got a womans number off an AIDS walk list. He got her number off an AIDS walk list? He what? Howd you find out? A friend of a friend of a friend of Susans. George! Pardon? Nothing. Listen Im sorry I just - Its o.k.! Theres nothing to be sorry about. I dont mind. You dont mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list? No not at all. No problem. (Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramers poker buddies who are filing out of Kramers apartment.) Ah youre lucky youre walkin out of here with a pair of pants on! You went all night? Jerry ah? Breakfast on me huh? Kramer are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like three hours! Youre never gonna make it! AIDS walk! Thats a cake walk. (George enters.) Hey! So George guess what? Lena found out how I got her number. Really? Howd she do that? A friend of a friend of Susans. My Susan? Whyd you tell her?! Because Jerry its a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything! Well you know what this means dont you? What? Youre cut off youre out of the loop! Youre cutting me off? No no no Jerry dont cut me off! You leave me no choice! Youre the media now as far as Im concerned! Cmon Jerry please! It wont happen again. If you were in the mafia would you tell her every time you killed someone? Hey a hit is a totally different story. I dont know George. So Lena was upset huh? You know what? That was the amazing thing. What it didnt bother her? No she said it was fine. Theres something very strange about this girl. What? Shes too good. Too good... I mean shes giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I cant be with someone like that! I see what you mean. I mean I admire the hell out of her. You cant have sex with someone you admire. Wheres the depravity? No depravity! I mean I look at her I cant imagine she even has sex. On the other hand... What? Thanks again for last night! Hey I didnt even use one. I thought you said it was imminent. Yeah it was but then I just couldnt decide if he was really sponge-worthy. Sponge-worthy? Yeah Jerry I have to conserve these sponges. But you like this guy isnt that what the sponges are for? Yes yes - before they went off the market. I mean now Ive got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I cant afford to waste any of em. You know youre nuts with these sponges. George is gettin frustrated! Uh Cosmo Kramer? Uh...o.k. youre checked in. Heres your AIDS ribbon. Uh no thanks. You dont want to wear an AIDS ribbon? No. But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon. I have to? Yes. See thats why I dont want to. But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon! You know what you are? Youre a ribbon bully. (Walks away.) Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on! Elaine and her sponges...shes got like a war chest full of them. Well I dont see why you just cant use condoms. Oh no no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged I said goodbye to the condom forever. Just once...for the make-up sex. Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight were way past that. Come on just once? No no...I hate the condom. Why? I can never get the package open in time. Well you just tear it open. Its not that easy. Its like Beat The Clock theres a lot of pressure there. Oh I dont wear the ribbon. Yeah Im against AIDS. I mean Im walking arent I? I just dont wear the ribbon. Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? (Kramer is frightened.) So you think youre sponge-worthy? Yes I think Im sponge-worthy. I think Im very sponge-worthy. Run down your case for me again...? Well weve gone out several times we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly Im actually quite good at it. You going to do something about your sideburns? Yeah I told you...Im going to trim my sideburns. And the bathroom in your apartment? Cleaned it this morning. The sink the tub everything got cleaned? Everything yeah. Its spotless. Alright lets go. (They head for the bedroom.) Hi. Hi! Hey look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins. Oh the shut-ins thats nice. You know theyre a very eccentric group. Because theyre shut in. Of course theyre not locked in theyre free to go at anytime. Oh by the way I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups. Hey thats dynamite. You know Lena I wanted to talk to you about something...you know because youre such a good person - Oh hang onto that thought - Im rinsing a sweater I left the water running. (Goes into the bathroom.) Hey Jerry can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet? Oh o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.) Thanks. So you were saying...? What? Nothing. No you said I was a good person... Oh... You seem like you want to tell me something. Tell you something...I do. What is it Jerry? You can tell me anything. Oh uh...you see these jeans Im wearing? Yeah. I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So you know. Thats it. (Lena is puzzled.) Come on George just tear it open. Im trying dammit. Tear it. I tried to tear it from the side you cant get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips. Here give it to me. Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.) Give it to me. (She rips it open.) Come on. Come on! Its too late. So! Whats it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon? No! Never. But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why arent you going to wear the ribbon!? This is America! I dont have to wear anything I dont want to wear! What are we gonna do with him? I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon! It completely turned her off. Well I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size? I dont wanna be a 32. Id kill to be a 32. She said I wasnt sponge-worthy. Wouldnt waste a sponge on me! That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open? Its probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind. You never run out do you? (Jerry smiles.) Wheres Kramer? Everythings finished here. Oh I told him hed never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer? Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turns back and looks at Kramer.) Hey wheres you AIDS ribbon? Good morning. Howd you sleep? Great. You? Fine fine. Everything o.k.? Yep. No regrets? Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing? What do you mean? Oh...I dont think so. Why not? I thought you said everything was fine. I wish I could help you but I cant afford two of em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)]
116,7,10,[You think shes happy? Who? (indicates with his head) The cashier. Ruthie Cohen? (surprised) You know her name? Sure. I dont think Ive ever spoken to her. Maybe thats why shes happy. (handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning gentlemen. What is this? (removing his coat) Yeah well its the latest offering from the Alex Theatre. That stinky old movie-house? (sits beside Jerry) Well you should smell it now. We fixed up the place. (gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus? (lighting his pipe) Well its a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes full wide-screen CinemaScope and if you come to the one oclock show you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood. Geoffrey who? Har-harwood Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production. Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV? Well why go to a fine restaurant when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monks) Listen you guys havent seen Lloyd Braun have you? Im supposed to meet him here. Lloyd Braun? What dyou have to meet him for? Well hes using his connections in the Mayors office to uh get the theatre landmark status. I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign. Well he did. You know after that he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution. Really? Yeah but hes doing a lot better now. Ive taken him under my wing. Oh then Im not worried. But he still needs all of our support. Now when he gets here treat him like hes one of the gang huh. (thoughtful) Breakdown huh? Hey Kramer. Oh hey Lloyd hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyds hand) How you doing? (slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself) Hi Jerry. Lloyd. George. Hello Lloyd. How you doing? Yeah well hes doing fine George. (offering packet) Gum? (peering) Thats an interesting package. Yeah its from China. Go ahead try a piece. Tell me thats not the most delicious gum youve ever tasted. Yes yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry) George? I dont chew gum. (chewing) Mmm different. Whered you get it? Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him where he got it. Nah dont bother. No its no problem. I dont want it. Jerry Jerry. Lloyd says its no problem. Hes capable of locating the gum. Alright. Mmm delicious. This is delicious. Mmm. You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didnt I pay with a twenty? Im sure I paid with a twenty. Hey. Hey. I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. Its a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin) What kind is that? Its Chinese gum Lloyd Braun gave me. Lloyd Braun? Hows he doing? (almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up. You know thats around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you dont think that I had anything to do with his breakdown do you? You know I remember when we parted company I was babbling incoherently for months. Yeah? Well I got news for you. The whole time that I was growing up all I ever heard from my mother was Why cant you be more like that Lloyd Braun? And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you. Right gotta get going. Arent you coming with us to Spartacus? Nah I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents. I thought your parents were outta town? Why dyou think Im going now? Georgie! Hey Mr Lazzari. Back in the old neighborhood ah? Yeah yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks. Oh snazzy car. Le Baron? Yeah eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight. The actor right? Something like that. Mind if I look under the hood? Oh no no no no. Go ahead Pop you always knew your cars. Oh Deena! Deena Deena l... look whos here. George Costanza is that you? Hey Deena come on give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh you look as pretty as you did back in high school. Boy those were some crazy times. Yeah yeah. Speaking of crazy did you hear about Lloyd Braun? The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one forty-seven fifty-two fifty-eight sixty-three and currently to our present period of time. Boy youre really getting into this arent you? Yes yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. Were hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings. Oh can Lloyd really do that? Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. Hes fine Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him Elaine. (concerned) What? Lloyd is here? What? No no Id rather... Hi Elaine. (big fake smile) Lloyd yes. Hello. Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats so we can all sit together. (reluctant) Oh well... I uh actually Lloyd Jerry and I have to sit in the front row uhm (desperately inventing) because uh because because he he forgot his glasses. So uh thanks for getting us... uhm well see you afterwards. That was odd. Am I crazy or does Jerry not wear glasses? (emphatic) Youre not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot em thats all. (puts an arm round Lloyds shoulder) Not crazy. Were all the way in the front row. Why couldnt we sit in the special seats? Im sorry but I didnt want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable. Nah you dont wanna be uncomfortable. Poor Lloyd. I know. Completely bonkers! Sorry I cant be so flip about this kind of thing. You know after what happened to Pop. Pop? What happened to Pop? I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. Thats why Im taking care of him. Oh I tell you they dont build em like this any more. (a little worried) He uh he doesnt have the auto shop any more? Uhn it was too much for him. (very worried) Uhm I I gotta go. What? I just remembered I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur thats enough. Pop. Pop put down the wrench Pop. Pop! POP!! s a great movie huh? Yeah. Sorry you forgot those glasses. I dont know what I was thinking. Howd you like that gum? (noncommittal) Errh. (slapping Jerry on the back) Ah he loved it. Hey Kramer you know what? There there isnt a light there in the ladies room. Yeah yeah. Its being repaired. Oh. Oh God. You alright? Ah I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again Lloyd. Officer. Officer is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean hes flooding the sidewalk. Its a waste of water. Couldnt he just use a broom? Lady you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey you with the hose. Yeah put these glasses on. (taking them) Well whats this for? Yeah well Lloyd hes gonna be here any minute now. So what? Well he thinks you wear those. Theyre from the lost and found at the Alex. Aw cmon Kramer this is ridiculous. Im not gonna put these on. Oh. Okay. So hell just think that the two of you didnt sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah thats very nice. Very nice. scuse me. I uh I was in here this morning and uh I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten. I dont think so. Oh I think so and I can prove it. You see I was doodling on the bill and uh so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well (smiles) thats mine. Would you mind opening up the register? Not unless you buy something. Fine Ill buy a pack of gum. Hey George. Thought you didnt chew gum? I dont. Take a look. I know I gave it to you. George would you mind. Im kind of in a hurry. (frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think Im gonna forget about this? I havent forgotten about this. I dont forget that easily! Hey Jerry look whos here. Ah Lloyd. Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum. (unenthusiastic) Oh the gum. Yeah lets all enjoy a chew huh? (still not happy) Uh alright. (he takes a piece) Oh boy. Now see this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies sitting around chewing gum huh? Mmm mmm yeah. So uh you know Lloyd he thinks he can get more of this. Well Lloyds a very industrious fellow. Im sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to. Actually the importers right in Chinatown. Ill introduce you to him you can get it whenever you want. s not necessary. Hey Jerry you know Lloyd wants to do you a favour. I know that Kramer. Well if you dont want to... No sure sure he wants to. Its very kind of you. Yeah Jerry he appreciates it. Dont you Jerry? Yes I do Kramer. So... Yeah? How about that Elaine today huh? Oh baby what was that all about huh? (to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre. I didnt see anything. Yeah you uh really missed a show buddy. Wooh ba-boom ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba. Youre probably wondering why I wanted to see you again. Well you know. (grins snorts) Its understandable. Im glad you feel that way. Because since my fathers breakdown I uh become very sensitive to the warning signs. Warning signs? Nervousness irritability paranoia. (disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... whatre you talking about? Im not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse not me. Yet again taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. All my friends do that. George Im only trying to help... Im... Im concerned. George? George are you listening to me? You see that woman on the horse? (points) She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah I mightve gotten it back but Lloyd Braun interfered! So again it all comes back to Lloyd. (rising to his feet) Hey! Hey you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Dont gallop away!! So you say she was on a horse? Im telling you that cashier is riding horses on my money. Well heres what I propose. Go down to the stables snoop around. See if any high-flying cashiers been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips. Hey. Well if it isnt Chesty La Rue. (sits beside Jerry) What? I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex. (laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre. Maybe its in the lost and found. Yeah I know. I have to go check it out. Its a beautiful button too you know. Its antique ivory. It was my mothers. You know the way you were wolfing down that popcorn maybe you ate it. Mr Har-harwood. Well what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre. Well I Im in a bit of a quandary. Ive misplaced my spectacles. Well lets look in lost and found shall we? Theyre half-glasses. Brown? Mmm yes yes. Uh yeah. Ah well if theyre not in the box Im sure theyll turn up soon. Listen could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop. Certainly. Oh my goodness. What a spanking button. (glances in mirror) Alright. Alright. (getting annoyed) Hang on its warming up! (angrily) Oh you mother... Hey! What is your problem? Oh hello its you! (angry) Listen lady I got six minutes left on that meter and Im not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur youre not so tough when youre not on your horse are you Ruthie? Your cars on fire. Aah! Fire! (after George) Merry Christmas! (shouting) Fire!! Your hose! Wheres your hose?!

Hey thanks. I owe you a big one. Yeah merry Christmas. (staring at the wreck) Whatever. Alright Im here. Wheres Braun? What hes not here yet? Look Ill go downtown to Chinatown with him but that is it! Listen Im gonna need those glasses. Why? Theyre Geoffrey Haarwoods. (proffering) Here try this pair. Aw these are really strong glasses. Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go? (lacking enthusiasm) Yeah yeah. (clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah hes all ready to go. Anybody see Elaine today? Oh yeah she called a little earlier. Shes coming over to check out lost and found. Maybe Ill stick around and see what shes wearing today. Or not wearing if you know what I mean. Absolutely. Lets just stick around. Ah tell you what theyre expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog here. Uh yeah. Id like a hotdog please. Are you outta your mind? Wh...wh...wh... whats the problem here? This hotdogs been here since the silent era. Youd have to be insane to eat it. No no no no no. This man is not insane. Now theres nothing wrong with it or you. Kramer maybe... No no no no. Ill show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please. (on your head be it) Okay. Mmm doesnt that smell good huh? Yeah here we go yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm oh. Thats delicious. Mmm. Its a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite) Uhm interesting texture. Its chewy. (he half-coughs half-retches) I gotta get some air. Excuse me. scuse me werent you told to stop using that hose? How would you happen to know that? Well uhm... I... (accusing) Youre that lady that was talking to the cops arent you? Uh... I... Hey Joe! No wait! Youre soaking me youre soaking me! Hey. Hey everybody. Whoah Elaine! Once again youve managed to top yourself. Cmon Jerry lets go. Cars out front. Lloyd? Lloyd? (exasperated) What is Lloyds problem? Look honey I know youre trying to get Lloyd to notice you but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt. Uhh I got sprayed with a hose. Yeah well Im sorry but the Alex is a family theatre not one of your swing joints. So you want my father to pay for this? You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there. And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too. No not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier. What cashier? You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot. To park her horse? No she wasnt on the horse. So your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse? Thats right. (points) And him! The man with the flowers? Yeah yeah the flower guy. Listen I know this all sounds a little crazy but... I cant believe it. Look thats Jerry Seinfeld. Who? Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry. Jerry! Over here Jerry. Its me! Jerry where ygoing? Its... whatre... (doubtful) That was your best friend? Yeah yeah but he doesnt wear glasses. That man was wearing glasses. I know. Dont you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun! Ill run in and get the gum. Alright. Got any money? (handing it over) Here. (climbing out of the car) Ill be back. Look Deena I know you think Im crazy but Im not. This is just a series of bad coincidences. I dont know George. I dont know what to believe. Believe me I am not crazy. Well I guess its possible. Here ygo. (indistinct) Got all this? Yeah. A hundred dollars worth. (incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?! You sure did. Am I crazy or is that a lotta gum? Its a lotta gum! Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses. Oh splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion Picture Costumes and Wardrobe. Ah the I.P.M.P.C.W. Well eh we prefer to call it the Institute. Is that from Henry the Eighth? Yes yes it is. Well you know were screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre? Well I... Id love to lend it to you but I doubt if it would fit a man of your impressive Raymond Massey-like physique. The only person who could really fit into this costume would have to be a short stocky man of somewhat generous proportions. (an idea occurs) You dont say. Youre really helping me out with this buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled. Yeah yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick. Remember youre a king you must project a Royal bearing. (angry undertone) Oh Im gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here. (handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum please? I beg your pardon your majesty but we dont accept bills with lipstick on the president. What? Huh so I had it all along. How dyou like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology. Oh my God! No no. Deena its not what you think. Th... this isnt mine. I got it from the Institute. The Institute. (shouting) Dee... Deena! Ahh Mr Haarwood. Well you certainly know how to dress for a premiere. Well thank you. Uh where is your friend King Henry? Oh he ran away. Hey Kramer. I need to talk to you. You know that button looks very familiar. Yes it it its antique ivory. I I think thats my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know Ive been looking all over for it. Did did you find it here? Yes it was in the lost and found. Shall I undo it? Oh yes of course you can. Oh thank you. Im a little ticklish. Oh. (giggly) Tickle tickle. Weve really gotta get that Elaine a boyfriend. Oh tell me about it.]
117,7,11,[(thinking) I cant believe Im going out with this guy. Wow! Hes so cool. Maybe hell write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh Elaine you are so beautiful. So so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so so interesting. If you want you can quit your job and never work again. Jerry you have got to come see him. He is so terrific. Maybe hell write a song about you. Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters. So I take it hes spongeworthy? Oh yeah. Well hes a musician. I guess theyre supposed to be very you know uninhibited and free. Well actually hes - hes not that way at all. Oh no? Yeah. In fact he....(moaning) Come on. Come on. I dont wanna! Elaine youre among friends. (sighs) Well actually he um doesnt really like to do... everything. Oh. Yeah. Its surprising. Yes it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you? No. No it doesnt bother me. I mean it would be nice. Im not gonna lie to you and say it wouldnt be nice. Sure. Why not? Youre there. Exactly. But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe hes you know still....kind of...he...not gonna happen. Hey Jerry! Listen I need you to come downstairs help me get my stuff outta the car. What stuff? I just came from the price club. Im loaded up baby. All right. What are you outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff. Course I will. These are staples. A four-pound can of black olives? Thats a staple? Lindsay olives Jerry. A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs? $17.50. You cant beat that. Look...look at this can of tuna! Yeah. Star Kist Jerry. Most tuna dont make their cut. This isnt for a person. This is for Biosphere 3. Hey Clyde! Hey Kramer! Whats happening dude? Yeah. Ahh. Hey this is Jerry here. How ya doin? Hi. You know Clyde he plays backup with John Germaine. John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine. Oh yeah? Oh yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin out. Theyre pretty hot and heavy. Is that right? Hey how bout giving me a hand? You know bring some of this stuff upstairs. Oh sorry Kramer I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life. Georgie can you zip me up? Yeah. Yeah one second. Well come on! All right. All right. Lets not get into panic mode! Lets not make a big deal outta this thing or were never gonna get through this night. Well Im meeting your in-laws I think I should look nice. My in-laws. Oh my.... So what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants to huh? I dont like that tie. Whats the matter with this tie? Ive hardly worn it. Its too thin. Theyre wearing wide now. How do you know what kind of ties they wear? Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if theres anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead! Oh get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue. George do you think he should wear a tie like that? Huh? I think he should wear whatever tie he wants. We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzers. Its out of our way. Why cant we pick up something at Lords? Its right over here. No! We have to go to Schnitzers! Ill show these people something about taste! This is gonna be fun. Hey youll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. Hes in your friend John Germaines band there. So what did he have to say? Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy. Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy? Yeah. What did you do that for? What? What if he tells John? Then Johns gonna think that I think that were hot and heavy. I dont want John thinking that Im hot and heavy if hes not hot and heavy. Oh Im trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I dont wanna make any big sudden movements. Ill frighten him away. Well Clyde might not tell him. How do you know that? I should have helped Kramer with those packages. Ohh! Let me give you a hand. Hey Kramer. I wonder could you do me a favor? Im taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder... Uh-huh. I wonder could you pick up my mail? Yeah. Sure. Sure. In fact you know what how would you like to take my hansom cab for the week? Drive the horse? Itll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a day. Ill split it with ya. Oh giddyup. Yeah. This is delicious Mrs. Ross. Oh. What are you complimenting her for? She didnt make it Rowenna did. What is this thing anyway? Its Cornish gamehen. What is that like a little chicken? Its uh its not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. Its a gamebird. Gamebird? Yeah. What do you mean? Like you - you hunt it? Yes. How hard could it be to kill this thing? I couldnt help but notice that you have quite a library in there. If I had a dime for every book hes actually read (laughing) Id be broke. More wine anyone? Yeah. Ill take some. Hmmm? Thank you. How do you like the Merlot? Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it? Oh mother. Shes uh shes heard of Merlot. Let me understand you got the hen the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So whos having sex with the hen? Why dont we talk about it another time. But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen a rooster and a chicken. Somethings missing! Somethings missing all right. Theyre all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them. Thats perverse. Did anybody see Firestorm? Firestorm thats a hell of a picture. Yeah. Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car -- Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I havent seen it yet. It doesnt have anything to do with the plot! Still! Still! I like to go in fresh! Oh mother of God. Of course uh this is Central Park. Uh this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty! Thank you. Now Id like to play something th -- well actually its my latest so its nice and fresh. Its called  Hot And Heavy. Thank God thats over. The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didnt like that. And who doesnt serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something! So they didnt give you a piece of cake? Big deal. It is a big deal. Youre supposed to serve cake after a meal. Im sorry. Its impolite. Not impolite...its stupid thats what it is. You gotta be stupid to do something like that! Your fathers absolutely right. Were sitting there like idiots drinking coffee without a piece of cake! What is this? The marble rye? Oh dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought. We forgot to bring it in. No I brought it in. They never put it out. Where is it? I dont know. Whered you put it? Right over there. Well its gone. You stole the bread? What do you mean stole? Its my bread. They didnt eat it. Why should I leave it there? Because we brought it for them! Apparently it wasnt good enough for them to serve. Is it possible they took it back? Who would bring a bread and take it back? Those people thats who. I think theyre sick. People take buses to get that rye. Maybe they forgot to put it out! Aw they didnt forget to put it out! Its deliberate! Deliberate I tell ya! He stole back the rye? Yeah. Why? Why? Why? Cause hes off his rocker! Thats why. So do the Rosss know? I dont know. Theyre all very suspicious. Why wouldnt they be? A rye bread doesnt just disappear. Now because of that stupid rye bread I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life. Bad situation. Ill tell you what Id like to do. Id like to replace that rye. What do you mean replace it? You know you go out you get another rye. Of course it would have to be the same one from Schnitzers. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is. Well there ya go. Whats so hard about that? Whats so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I cant just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment! All right. All right. Dont panic. Lets just think about it. Get the Rosss out of the apartment. That cant be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know Kramers been driving that hansom cab. So? Well Kramerll take them around for a while. And its their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think theyd like that? Are you kidding? People love it. Theres something about the clip clop clip clop. Theyre nuts for it. So they go off for the ride by the time they come back the bread is there. What about Susan? Shes working late that night. Were - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight oclock so Ill set up the ride for seven oclock. Beautiful! You think Kramerll do it? Of course Ill do it. Id be happy to. So all I gotta do is be there at seven? Yeah. Just take em out and ride em around for about..half an hour. Hey. What the hell are you doing there? Its Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some? No. No thanks. Jerry I think I bought too much at that price club. I dont have any room for it all. Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment? Just put it under your shirt. Have you ever seen a Schnitzers rye? It - its huge! Ill tell ya what Ill bring it over. Ill stop by Schnitzers Ill come by five after seven right after they leave. Oh this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing) Hey. Is that your horse outside? Yeah. Thats Rusty. What?

First guy I like in a really long time. I mean were getting along everything is just great. I mean all right so he doesnt do... everything and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy. So you think Clyde told him? He wrote a song about it! Well maybe its a good thing. No! Its not a good thing! Its a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what thats like? No but Ive read articles and I must say it doesnt sound very pleasant. You know one of these days something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to! No. Im gonna be just fine but as far as your situation youre seeing him tonight so talk to him about it. I cant! Hes got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I dont wanna upset him. Aw what the hell Ill upset him. Yeah George I gotta tell ya this is a very nice gesture. We really appreciate it. Aw well you know its your anniversary.

You know George we havent done anything romantic like this in ....years. (thinking) Oh my God its 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? Hell never show up! Ah ha! There he is. Right on time as usual. 53. 53. Id like a marble rye no plastic in a bag. Ah! Youre lucky. Its our last one.

Oh no no no wait a second wait a second... th-th-that-- Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit didnt she? Kramer it is not what you think. Ah Ah Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think youre gaga over this dame. Shes twisted you around her little finger and now youre willing to sell me and Elaine and whoever else you have to right down the river. And what about yooou?!? Tryin to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune built on sweat and toil manufacturing quality OHenry candy bars for honest hard-working Americans! Youre just out for sex!! Youre just out for money!! Ah Ah Ahhhhh!!!!!! Mrs. Costanza? Yesss? My name is George Steinbrenner Im afraid I have some very sad new about your son. (gasps) I cant believe it he was so young. How could this have happened? Well hed been logging some pretty heavy hours first one in in the morning last one to leave at night. That kid was a human dynamo. Are you sure youre talking about George? You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza? What the hell did you trade Jay Buener for?!? He had 30 home runs and over 100 RBIs last year. Hes got a rocket for an arm - - you dont know what the hell youre doin!! Well Buhner was a good prospect no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps bat. They kept saying Ken Phelps Ken Phelps. Im not here leave a message. Jerry its Frank Costanza Mr. Steinbrenners here George is dead call me back! Hello? Hey its George. nan Where have you been?!? What? I just got the most bizarre message from you father Steinbrenner is at you house they think youre dead! Dead? nan Yeah and we had an accident with your car its a its a little crumpled. My cars a little crumpled?!? Yeah yeah I didnt know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh wait a second wait a second they saw the car they saw the blood they couldnt find ya thats why Steinbrenner thinks youre dead! Allright I gotta head back right away Ill-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here. Well you gotta call your parents. I cant Steinbrenner might still be there! Arent you gonna tell your parents youre still alive? OOuuoo! They could use the break! Elaine do you see this? Do you see what Im holding in my hands? Yeah its a bra. I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top. (sits on the corner of the desk) What exquisite beauty I ran down the hallway to talk to her but the elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day. w-What is this all about? I wanna market this item as a new direction in womens fashion. nan Oh-oh but- Were gonna sell this as a top. Heres the angle: Zelda Fitzgerald aaaand somebody in the 20s wearing this at wild parties driving all the men crazy (tosses the bra on Elaines desk)... Have it on my desk by the end of the week. Come in come in. Mr. Steinbrenner-- Ahhh Ahhh! Ah ah ah! Is it you? nan Yeah its me sir. Its been a harrowing few days. uuh After the car accident I-I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on grubs and puddle water until a kindly old gentleman picked me up. Grubs huh? Gotta admit I never tasted one of those. nan Anyway as I was lying in the puddle I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey and we wouldnt have to give up that much. Well dont tell it to me George tell it to the new Assistant to the General Manager. I didnt get the job? Well once you were dead we couldnt just sit on our hands. We had to make a move... But you still have your old job. Of course well have to dock you for the time you missed. Were running a ball club here. If I give special treatment to you everyone will want it. Next thing you know its chaos! And I can tell you this (George closes the door) chaos does not work for the New York Yankees! Not as long as Im running the show! So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy the bra for Miss Mishke would you say that was correct? Yes...ummm (leans into the microphone pulling it closer it squeaks) yes thats correct. And you have also brought with you another bra (goes over to the table and pulls a bra out of a bag) exactly like the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in! Yes thats correct. Uh what was you golf score the last round you played... uh before you shoulder was injured? Three under par. Oooohhhh three under par Hmm...Thats what the professionals shoot isnt it? Well if theyre lucky. Well would you tell this jury exactly what you saw at the corner of 83rd Street and Columbus? I...dont remember. Well did you or did you not see the defendant wearing the bra? I dont know. Maybe. Mr. Seinfeld I might remind you that you are under oath. Now I ask you again did you or did you not see this woman wearing a bra?!? ....Alright alright I saw her!... And she was beautiful in that bra! Im crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging free wheeling attitude! This court will come to order! No further questions your honor. You may step down. Well Kramer I think we got this wrapped up. Yeah yeah...Whats your read Stan? Youre close youre on the green. You just have to go for the cup. What do you mean? Have her try on the bra see if it fits. No no no no! nan Do it Jackie. Stans the man. Stan? Who the hell is Stan? nan Hes my caddy. Youre caddy?!? This is a big mistake! nan Gu-gu- cada- Your honor we request at this time that Miss Mishke...try on the bra. (bangs the gavel twice) This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke try it on.

You cant eat a sandwich without Dijon. (sarcasm) Yeah youre right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand. Hey hey hey. Im getting a vibe here. What are you unhappy with our arrangement? What arrangement? Well I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge and you could take whatever you want from mine. (sarcasm) Yeah well lemme know when you get something in there and I will. Oh hey. Hey. Hey. Whats with your neck? Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself. Well if its any consolation I did get her number. (sitting) Ah I think I really strained it. Ow. Aw I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it. Ach maybe. Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it. I dont know. Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it... (patience exhausted) You know what why dont you just shut the hell up? Awright. God. Man this is killing me. Right now I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away. Aw you really hurting huh? Oh Kramer its just awful. Uh hmm. Well your arterioles have constricted. Alright lean forward relax. (worried) What? What? Encounter shiatsu. Wait a minute. Kramer you know what youre doing here? (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the bodys natural pressure points. Ah hah. (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre. (seriously worried) Wha...? Hes a genius. Here we go... From pain will come pleasure. Uh? Voila. (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god! Yeah. Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone! Whats even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics. Awright my work is done here. (big smile) Oh man! Kramer thank you! (closing the door) Yeah you can send that bike over any time. (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What what is he talking about? I dunno. (realising) Oh cos you said youd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck. You really think he wants the bike? Oh yeah. It took him like ten seconds! Well thats the most hes worked in the last four months. I think they really went for that Soda. What are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring you. Ah alright. Believe me that kids gonna be called Soda. I can tell you I would never name my child Soda. Oh no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh you ready? Yeah. What is that? Sign language? No Seven. Seven Costanza? Youre serious? Yeah. Its a beautiful name for a boy or a girl... ...especially a girl. Or a boy. I dont think so. What you dont like the name? Its not a name. Its a number. I know. Its Mickey Mantles number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name it is also a living tribute. Its awful. I hate it! (angry) Well thats the name! (also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to be named Seven! (yelling) Awright lets just stay calm here! Dont get all crazy on me! Seven? Yeah I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating and eventually seven years to life. Yeah youre doing that child quite a service. (adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven. Awright lets see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza thats original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl. Alright you having a good time there? I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House. (shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me Jerry. I had this name for a long time. Oh I forgot to call Christie. Christie? Thats the one you met in the antique store? Yeah she had this great black and white dress with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero. And you met her in an antique store! I dont know how you do it! (smug) Im not engaged. Ah I got it. Got what? (putting the items on the counter) Got the answer Jerry. Refrigerator problem is solved. Oh its no problem. You can take whatever you want. Oh I will. But now Im accountable. Alright I take what I want. Here. I write it down. (he writes) One cupcake. And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple. Sort of a mooching inventory. No no. Not mooching. Cos at the end of the week you add em all up and you give me the bill. Alright. Alright now look I gotta run some errands so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike you hang onto it for me alright? Kramer I dont know if youre getting that bike. Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we cant take each other at our word all is lost. (waving at the bowl) Oh yeah yeah. Put that on my tab. Well this is it. The food is atrocious but the busboys are the best in the city. Yes thank you. The same outfit? The exact same outfit. How many days was it between encounters. Three. Three days. Well maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know she did laundry the day after she met you everything got clean and she started all over again. Possibly but then shouldnt the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle? Maybe she moved it up in the rotation. Why? Its our first date shes already in reruns? Very curious. Indeed. You know Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day. Well if she splits the atom Ill let it slide. (picking up his coat) Awright Im heading home. Hey did Susan change her mind about the name? (standing) Not yet but shes weakening. You know George just because your life is destroyed dont destroy someone elses. Its Mickey Mantle Jerry. My idol. How about Mickey? Mickey? (incredulous) Mickey! Hey buddy. (holding up a can) Hey is this your half a can of soda in the fridge? No thats yours. My half is gone. What? Yeah I put my half a can here on the tab. Why whats your beef? You cannot buy half a can of soda. Well why not. Well I dont wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here but you know the sound a can makes when you open it? Yeah. That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this okay... ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit youve bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple not a half of a banana... Alright. ...You bite it you bought it. Alright alright. Ill make the necessary adjustments alright. Thank you. Yeah. Hey. Oh. (pointedly) So hows the neck? Nice and loose? Lookit Kramer you are not getting this bike. I dont even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean its a girls bike. (deadly serious) Its a verbal contract. We had a deal. No we didnt. You take these things too literally. Its like saying youre hungry enough to eat a horse. Well my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher. This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is you just cant have the bike. Boy I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean George yeah I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you Elaine... I always put you up here... ...Theyre over here. Now youre... aww-whawww. (grudging) Alright. (points) Digidi. Aw cmon. Its a fantastic name. Its a real original nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it. Well I dunno how original its gonna be any more. Why not? Well I was telling Carrie about our argument and when I told them the name they just loved it. So whatre you saying? Theyre gonna name their baby Seven. (disbelief) What?! Theyre stealing the name?! Thats my name I made it up! I cant believe that theyre using it. (anger) Well now its not gonna be original! Its gonna lose all its cachet! I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with. (rage) Oh its got cachet baby! Its got cachet up the yin-yang! (in pain) Oh god! Oh god. (bitter) Kramer! Watch your step. (pain) Oh ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer. Excuse me. Elaine? Huh? Over here. I thought that was you. Youre Jerrys friend right? Yeah yeah. Uh Christie? Yes. How ydoing? (bearing up) Im fine. Well I gotta run. It was good to see you. (after Christie) Okay oh it was good to good to see you. You got that right! (scorn) Hey youre riding a girls bike. (shouting) Kramer! Kramer! Hello. Hello Ken. Its George Costanza. I think we need to talk. (angry shout) Kramer! Kramer!! Hey Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet? Havent seen him. Hows the neck? His chiropractic job was a crock. Its even worse than it was before. Boy Im surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a persons spine around. Hey you know what I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. Whats her name Christie? You saw her? What was she wearing? I dont know. I couldnt see. I couldnt look down because of my neck. Didnt you get a glimpse? An impression? What dyou care? Both times Ive seen her shes worn the same dress. Did you have a nice ride? Oh great ride. Oh thats good. Cos it was your last! Whatre you talking about?! We had a deal! (anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldnt even crawl out of bed this morning. Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week. What? You never told me that. Well its common sense. Jerry what is he talking about? Hes being ridiculous. Alright look. Jerry you know the whole story you should settle this. Yeah Jerry. Well Im flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom but unfortunately my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator. Yeah Id go for that. Would you go for that? Alright Im down. Course it would have to be someone who hasnt heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark it cannot be swayed by pity compassion or human emotion of any kind. So thats the situation. Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly has a legitimate claim to the bicycle and yet the bicycle can have only one rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee I believe the law is all we have. (getting worked up) Its all that separates us from the savages who dont deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels into mailboxes where they dont belong!!... Newman! ...But you must promise That you will abide by my decision no matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word? Uh yeah. Yeah. Alright lets begin. (excited) Ooh my cocoa! Why cant we use Seven? Its my name. I made it up. You cant just steal it. Well its not as if Susans pregnant. Youve already postponed The wedding. Who knows if youll ever get married. Hey hey hey. Dont worry about me. Im not a waffler. I dont waffle! Right were both big Mickey Mantle fans and we love the name. Its very unusual. (shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda. (emphatic) Well we dont care for Soda. You dont care for Soda?! (worked up) No no. We dont like Soda at all! (shouting) How dyou not like Soda?! Its bubbly its refreshing! Oh! What is it? I felt something. Are you okay honey? I think Im going into labour. Oh god oh god. Okay lets not panic. Lets just get to the hospital... Okay. ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed right here. What about Six? Nine. Thirt... thirteens no good. Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen! Are you okay Jerry? You seem quiet. No Im just a little uh worn out. I know exactly what you mean. Oh Im sure you do. What in gods name is going on here? Is she wearing the same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these like Superman? Ive got to unlock this mystery. (horrified) Oh my god! Oh. Ahh. I cant go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go back to my apartment so I can change? Change? (thoughtful) Yes I think thats a super idea. Are we almost there? Just keep breathing okay. (deep breaths) Okay okay. Okay. (to Carrie) You know the thing is I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven. Nows not the best time George! (to Carrie) Its just that I know her and boy... (firm) George! Shes in labour! (angry shout) So am I! Well youve both presented very convincing arguments. On the one hand Elaine your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm? And Kramer you did provide a service in exchange for compensation. But does the fee once paid not entitle the buyer to some assurance Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer. Not for any man... ...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the bike down the middle and give half to each of you. (shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?! Alright fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half. No no no. Give it to her. Id rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman give it to her I beg you. Yeah yeah y-yeah. Not so fast Elaine! Only the bikes true owner would rather give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer the bike is yours! What?! Sweet justice. Newman you are wise. (frustration) But this isnt fair! Lookit my neck is still hurting me and now you have the bike?! Well tell it to the judge honey. Im going for a ride. Here we are. (looking around) Ah so this is the Fortress of Solitude. Well I guess Ill go change. Yes change. By all means change. August seventeen nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! She never changes! Oh my god. (looking around) Shes gotta have hundreds of these dresses. There must be a secret stash around here somewhere. Ahem! Are you looking for something? Whatre you doing? I thought you were changing. No I Im thinking we should just call it a night. No no. Cmon put something else on. Its early lets go out. If its all the same to you I think Im just gonna go to bed. You know Im kinda tired myself. Maybe Ill just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning youll get dressed well walk out together. Both dressed different clothes. Well Ill be in the same clothes. Youll of course be in different clothes because its your apartment. But well go downstairs me in my same clothes you in your different clothes. (unequivocal) Jerry. I dont think so. You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab? (gesturing) Get out. (pleading) Tell me what youre wearing tomorrow. Ill help you lay it out on the bed. Okay breathe honey. Breathe. (to Carrie) You know youre really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then! (shouts) Im having a baby!! George youre not getting Seven! Now get outta here!! (desperate) Please! I have so little! Sorry sir its family only. Im family. Im having sex with the cousin! Seven!! Hello Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you cant break up with me over the phone. Cmon you gotta do this in person. It doesnt even have to be one on one you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait dont hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why dyou wear the same dress all the time? Hello. (indicating the cereal) Hey Jerry if youre gonna be snacking on these you cant expect me to pay for the whole box. Alright hobo Joe. I didnt wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here but its the end of the week so I added up your tab. (does a double take) Yikes. I know. Pretty steep. Well I dont have this kind of cash. Few do. Im good for it. Yeah well until this bill is paid... ...the food court is closed. (opening the door) Alright. Ill get that money for you in five minutes. And dont eat any more. Hey thats my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman pedalling the Schwinn for all hes worth. He rings the bell. Gangway! This is my bike! Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course I had to make some minor modifications you know. Solid tires reinforced seatpost heavy duty shocks. But baby this is one sweet ride. (chasing Newman) No you better gimme back that bike. Newman gimme... Hey!! Help me!]

No I cant feel anything. Well whatre you gonna do with all that money? Actually I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity. (pleased) Really? (deadpan) No. Well you should Jerry. No to tell you the truth I was thinking of buying my father a new car. Now you see thats nice. Maybe a Cadillac. (smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la. Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. Hes always wanted one his whole life hes never been able to afford it. (decisive) Im gonna do it. Youre gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one. Oh isnt that what its all about? Who was Pippi Longstocking? Pippi Longstocking? (thoughtful) Hmm I dont dont know. Did she have anything to do with Hitler? Hitler? (thinks) Maybe. Hey. Hey George. Have you seen Jerry?

(chuckles) So what dyou what dyou think? (urgent) Move a pinkie if its yes. Can you move a pinkie? Yhello. (inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi uh ah Mister Kramer ah this is McNab down at the phone company. Weve got a report about some trouble on your line. Hmm. Well I havent had any trouble. Uh the thing is we happen to have a man right in your neighbourhood. (playing along) Ohh is that right? Well I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting. We can fix that. We can fix that. (sitting back on the couch) Oh can you? Thats funny because as it happens I dont have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that. Oh right. (laughing it off) Im sorry I was looking at the wrong work order. Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? Ive got something on the stove. Hey McNab! Chunnels on HBO tonight. Why dont you stop by? Alright. Next thing on the agenda the restoration of the fence at the Briarwood gate. At the present time we are still accepting bids. Cmon Morty its been broken for six months already. What the hell are you doing? Well I as your president have to find the best price and right now I for one do not think its cost-feasible. (half to himself) Ill bet you dont. What was that? Cmon Morty the jig is up! Whatre you talking about? Im sorry. Im sitting here the whole meeting holding my tongue. Ive known you a long time Morty but I cannot hold it in any longer. Whats going on Jack? Ill tell you whats going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds from the treasury. Stealing?! What proof do you have? Proof? You want proof? Hes driving around in a brand new Cadillac. Now what more proof do you want? My son bought me that car! Your son? Yeah. Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act last year at the playhouse. Hes lucky he can pay his rent! Jacks right! He stinks! Its his material. I tell you he bought it for me! (bangs table with his fist) I move for a full investigation! I second. ...go introduce myself. Hey! Whatre you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? Thats another Marisa Tomei movie and youve seen that one too. (jokingly) What dyou have a thing for her? (laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short stocky bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu ha ha. Like thats her type. Huh. Shes an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides I dont even know her. Its not like anyones trying to fix us up. Who who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei? What are you talking about? Have I told you how much I love you today? Not in the last fifteen minutes. Well I do love you very much. And I love you Marisa. Well then cmon get dressed. Were going to be late for the premiere. Impeachment? Thats right. Have you ever heard of anything like that? Can they do that? If they get the votes. I told you we shouldnt have let him give us the car. Didnt you tell em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it. It doesnt make a difference. They think were in cahoots. You know you could put a fence around these condos and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference! No-ones ever been impeached before. I couldnt live here. Wed have to move to Boca. Hello? Oh hi Evelyn. Hello Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone with Saul Brandus. Whatd he say? Hes voting to impeach. Not because he think you stole the money but mainly because you never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Romans show. I did so thank him! (admonishing) No he never heard you. (prods Mortys back) I told you he didnt hear you. Ah hes deaf anyway. Now my sources tell me theres three votes for impeachment three votes against impeachment and one undecided. Whos that? Mrs Choate. Whos she? Oh that one. Shes been a member of the board longer than anybody. Shes very tough to deal with. Maybe we should have her over for coffee and explain our side of it? Thats a good idea. Okay. Ill see you at the Lichtenbergs tonight. (surprise) The Lichtenbergs? Yes theyre having a party. We werent invited. Oh. Probably they think youre too good for them. You know because of the car.]

Either way we need to get into your apartment and do a safety check. (impressed) Ohh youre good. You are really good. (confused) Whatre you talking about? Marisa Tomei! I just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasnt even that nervous. You know I cant remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I usually Im pacing all over the room Im... (looking at her watch) Okay well thats all the time we have for today. Why dont we pick up with this next week? Hey where you going? I got stuff to do. What? You cant leave yet. Why not? We have to discuss my alibi. Alibi? What does that have to do with me? I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. Shes gonna want to know what Im doing. I cant use Jerry hes in Florida. Oh so you wanna say you were with me? Yes. (pulls a face) Puh. Okay fine. You were with me. Wait a second wait. Why are we together? What is the difference? Because if you ever see her and it comes up we have to be in sync. Hmm? Okay. Now why do I have to see (points) you? Ah! Because Im going to the dentist and Im afraid and I want you to go with me. (dismissive) Its no good. (pointedly) Okay. Fine. What? I dont like the way you just rejected my suggestion. Hey hey lets not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process. I thought that my suggestion was good. And I think you couldve been a little more tactful. (explaining with lots of hand gestures) Okay look. Weve never worked together on a lie. Now you dont understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. Its not a personal thing yknow? Were just trying to come up with the best possible lie. Thats what this is all about. (weary) Okay. Alright? Okay. Okay. Fine. Good. Fine fine fine. Okay. How about this? What?

Whats his name? Who is he? (after a moments thought) Art Vandelay. (incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend? Thats your boyfriend. What does he do? Hes an importer. Just imports? No exports? (getting irritated) Hes an importer-exporter. Okay? Okay. So Im dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem were discussing? (thoughtful) Yes. Yes. (sighs) Yi-yi-yi. Ah! (explaining with hand gestures) How bout this? How about hes thinking of quitting the exporting and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem because why not do both? (irked) Oh what? You dont like that suggestion either? Its very complicated. (definitely irritated) You know it seems to me that its all you and none of my ideas are getting in. You know I mean you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right? Whatre you doing? Are you making coffee? Yeah. Well maybe you better make a pot of tea too. Morty youre driving me crazy. Look I dont want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach me Ill be a laughing stock. You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences. There she is. Hello. Hello Mrs Choate.

So what does he do? Hes an importer-exporter. What kind of problems are they having? (not happy delivering Elaines lie) Well he uh he wants to uh quit the exporting and uh focus just on the importing. And its a problem because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing. Are you having an affair with Elaine? (trying to laugh it off) Right. Cmon! Im having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine I wouldnt tell you Im going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see and then I would go see Ela..Elaine. Huh? (yelling after the fleeing Kramer) Ill get you! Ill get you Kramer! You wont get away with this! Alright are you ready to eat? (glancing at her watch) Oh right lets go. Jerry lets go its time to eat. Were going to dinner. (confused) Dinner? W..What time is it? (pulling on a coat) Its four-thirty. (bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty? By the time we sit down itll be quarter to five. I dont understand why we have to eat now. We gotta catch the early-bird. Its only between four-thirty and six. Yeah. They give you a tenderloin a salad and a baked potato for four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six? Cant we eat at a decent hour? Ill treat okay? Youre not buying us dinner. (emphatic) Im not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks Ill tell you that! Alright (sitting on the couch) well wait. (pointedly) But its unheard of. ...So anyway if you think about it manure is not really that bad a word. I mean its newer which is good and a ma in front of it which is also good. Ma-newer  right? (laughing) Youre so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure. Ma and the newer. Did you just make that up? What you think Im doing material here? (laughs) No no. Its hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously funny. (modest) And Im a little tired. So tell me how is it that a man like you so bald and so quirky and funny how is it youre not taken? Well Marisa. See the thing is... Im sort of engaged. What? Im you know engaged. Hey look theres a spot right in front. Was that delicious or what? Where you gonna get a better meal than that? Better than Dannys. Dannys? (scoffs) Cmon! Hello Jack. Doris. Hello hello. Jack. Hello Jerry. Hi Doris. Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well missed the early bird. Yeah so?

Tomorrow they kick you out youll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac. Theyre not kicking me out. You dont have the votes. Thats what you think. Well see. Yes we will. Awright lets eat already. Hi Susan. Hi. Hi. Come in come in. Have a seat. (standing) Uh Elaine I have to ask you a question. Oh sure. (dead serious) Are you having an affair with George? (disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha no. (laughter) Dont be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean why would anyone wanna sleep... ...Well obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George? Ohh because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some problem that you were having. (recalling the arranged lie) Yeah yeah I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend. Art Vandelay? Yeah Art Vandelay. Im sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot. (smiling) No no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. Its okay. Oh just forget that we ever talked. Okay? It is so forgotten. Alright. Okay. (relieved) Okay no problem. So was George helpful at all? (unconvincing) Yeah. Oh yes yes he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm because you know Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm you know hes an importer-exporter. (not convinced) Yeah. (explaining with gestures) Uhm George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing. (spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to give up the exporting. Whatd I say? The importing. (caught out) I did. Uh... So what does he uh import? (extemporising) Uh... chips. Oh. What kinda chips? Potato. Ah. (embroidering) Some corn. And what does he export? Diapers. (fake smile) Im sorry for bothering you. Oh no its okay. Okay. (to herself) Cmon George pick up. Oh pick up. Oh pick up. Hi. Hi. (pointedly) So George what does Art Vandelay import? Matches? Long matches. ...There she is. Okay if I can have your attention for a minute here. Were calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two to consider a motion of impeachment of our president (indicating) Morty Seinfeld. Nervous Jack? What for? Because I have the votes. Nice to see you Mrs Choate. Hello Morty. Building A. Are you for or against the motion to impeach? What does that mean? It means if youre for the motion youre against Morty. So why dont you say that? Hey Im running the meeting. If you think so. Building A? For impeachment. Building B? Against impeachment. Building C? For impeachment. Building D? Against impeachment. (a whisper to Morty) I cant believe you got that old bag. Help! Someone help! Shut up you old bag! (after Jerry) Oh thief! Thief! Its him. (pointing at Morty) Its your son. Now I know where I saw him. He stole my marble rye. My son never stole anything. Hes a good boy. They should lock him up. (pointing at Morty) Like father like son. (thumps table) I change my vote. I vote to impeach! Me too. I change my vote. All those in favour say aye. Aye. All opposed. The ayes have it. The motion passes. Morty Seinfeld you are officially dismissed as condo president.

You win okay? You win. I cant do it any more. What dyou want from me? Apology? Alright Im sorry. There I said it Im sorry Im sorry. I see now how we made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well thats gonna change. From now on no more nine to twelve no more one to five. Were gonna have appointments. Eleven oclock is gonna mean eleven oclock. And if we cant make it were gonna call you tell you why. (worked up) For gods sakes if a doctor can do it why cant we? (almost sobbing) Anyway thats it. The bags are in the car I guess we better go.]
122,7,16,[Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and were gonna knock them off. Not the Massai the sandals. Ill need a urine sample. Right. You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils. Oh Come on. Hey George you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday? Hey yeah. My parents want to come too is that ok? Yeah sure. My parents will be there.

No hes doing mine next. Theyre low flow you know. Low flow? Well I dont like the sound of that. So what are your parents doing here in new York? Well they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment my father left office in disgrace. So what are their plans? Well this is the problem. Theyre moving into this new development. Heres the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But theyre not quite ready to go back so theyre in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leos. You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment? No Leos not there. Hes got a girlfriend Lydia. In fact he moved in with her. Uncle Leos having regular sex? Yeah I know. It devalues the whole thing. (answering phone) Hello? Jerry what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday. You gotta be there at 4:30. But it comes on 11:30. Yeah well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30. How long they been doing this? 30 years. Helen did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon? All right Ill see you later. Georgie how come your parents never moved to Florida? Yeah that is odd isnt it? Yeah it is. I mean theyre retired. No economic reason for them to be here. They have no friends. No social reason for them to be here. Youre all grown up. Yeah theyre all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right so Ill uh get back to you. Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice. I dont know maybe get an ice tray? I can do that. You know Dad just called me. Yeah I know. His phlebitis is acting up. Yeah all right well I got some people here. Ok. All right bye. (to Elaine): You see this? Any thought pops into their head theyre calling me because its a local call now. Ahh. Im used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I cant handle this. Plus I got the dinners I got the pop ins. They pop in! Its brutal! They have no idea when theyre going back to Florida? The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida. Hows that gonna happen? Its about time you called your uncle. Weve got to do this once a week. (to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So hows Lydia? Ah shes a real tiger. I dont know how you do it. What? A man like you limiting yourself to one woman I dont know. But its none of my business. What are you talking about? Well... Look at this I told them medium rare its medium. Hey it happens. I bet that cook is an anti-Semite. He has no idea who you are. They dont just overcook a hamburger Jerry. All right. Anyway the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. Cmon Uncle Leo Ive seen the way women look at you. Whens the last time you looked in a mirror? Youre an Adonis! Youve got beautiful features lovely skin youre in the prime of your life here you should be swinging. If I were you Id tell this Lydia character Its been real move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business. Believe me I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way I cant see a flaw. Well keep looking. Im afraid I have some bad news Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa. What? Why not? Im afraid its your urine Elaine. You tested positive for opium. Opium? Thats right Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally. Ihats impossible Ive never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake. Not a chance. Im afraid Ill just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict Elaine. Obviously Mr. Peterman theres something wrong with this test. I dont take opium. Let me take another one please? Ill call the doctor right now Ill take a pop urine test. All right Elaine. Oh thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) Ill be ready in three minutes. Whew! Boy its cold outside huh? Oh these New York winters huh. Bitter cold bitter. I was out for five minutes before I couldnt feel my extremities. What extremities? You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. Thats almost eighty. Yeah I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens seventy-three. So George why are you here? What I cant stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table) Whats this. Thats where the Seinfelds are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games you clean up. I dont bet. What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there. I dont swim. You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks. Are you trying to get rid of us? Rid? Nah cmon the word is care. Care. I care about your comfort be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away. No? Jerry? Jerry! Wha you too? Yeah! These showers are horrible. Theres no pressure I cant get the shampoo out of my hair. Me either. If I dont have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. Im not Kramer. You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. Im gonna have to shower in the dressing room. (leaving) Aw. Where are you going? I gotta find another shower. They got you too? This stuff is awful! Im not Newman! Oh Elaine. Yeah. Kramer you look terrible. Look I need the keys to your apartment I gotta take a shower. Whats wrong with your shower? Theres no water pressure. Why dont you just go see Jerry? Jerrys got nothing. Newmans got nothing. Youre the only one I know whos got the good stuff and I need it bad baby cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out. (busting in) Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I wont have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else! Mr Peterman! What are you doing? Elaine youre out of control. You need help. Huh? I know what youre going through. I too once fell under the spell of opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown all of the clothing traders had gone but a different sort of trader still lurked about. Just a taste he said. That was all it took. Mr. Peterman I dont know whats going on here. I am not addicted to anything. Oh Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The price? Your soul. Oh and by the way you have til 5:00 to clear out your desk. Youre fired. All they serve is chicken? Theres more food down the hall. Wrap it up well take it home. Oh hi. Hello Seinfelds. Hello. Hi. This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini. Oh Jerry. I dont know how you could do this. Im so nervous for you. Actually Im drunk. Hey hey how was Florida? Well we just bought a new place down there. I know we were looking at the brochure. What? Why you thinking of moving? Not really. Because if you are you shouldnt. Theres nothing available in that development. Are you telling me theres not one condo available in all of Del Boca Vista? Thats right. They went like hotcakes. Howd you get yours? Got lucky. Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?! I know this doesnt seem like work to any of you if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall I could just get a little personal space. How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand thats a mistake. But twice? Yeah its hard to figure. I mean I lost my job I cant go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari. Ah the bush-men? And the bush-women. (also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldnt help overhearing. I notice youre eating a poppy seed muffin. Yeah I eat these muffins all the time. Well you know what opium is made from... (as though receiving a revelation) Poppies! Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry lemme ask you I saw some people back there they look like.. family? Is that family? Yeah I got some family backstage. Course my familys nuts; theyre crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day hes one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean the spaghettis not al dente? Cooks an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesnt get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite. Hey listen to this Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now hes moving back into his apartment. You know what this means my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh Im terribly sorry. Hey Kramer my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida isnt that great? (halfheartedly) Yeah well Im really happy for ya. Hey youre not giving it to me man. Whats wrong? I just took a bath Jerry. A bath? No good? Its disgusting. Im sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me. Well you used to sit in that hot tub? Jerry that was superheated water nothing could live in that. (offering a plate) Chicken? Oh yeah. Well this youre not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds! Poppy seeds! Well that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken? Yeah. Thanks. So Im gonna get tested again later hopefully Ill get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa. Hello Newman. Hello Jerry. Well I may have a solution to our little problem. Elaine would you excuse us? Oh cmon Newman. I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens door) If you dont mind? Jerry? Look sister go get yourself a cup of coffee all right? Beat it! (Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right now heres the lowdown. From a certain connection Ive been able to locate some black market shower heads. Theyre all made in the former Yugoslavia and from what I hear the Serbs are fanatic about their showers. Not from the footage Ive seen. Nevertheless sometime this afternoon behind the Market Diner an unmarked van will be waiting. Im expecting the call at any time. Are you in? Im down. Jerry? So Georgie we have some big news for you. Big news? Were moving to Florida. (ecstatic) What? Youre moving to Florida!?! Thats wonderful! Im so happy! (pause) For you! Im so happy for you! Oh what do you need this cold weather for? Has nothing to do with the weather its because of the Seinfelds. What do you mean? They dont want us there so were going. Were moving right into Del Boca Vista! So youre moving there for spite! Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do! Thats right who the hell are they? How dare they?! So Georgie are you gonna come to visit us? Oh every chance I get. (warmly) Ohhh. Jerry? Jerry! Im busting! Im busting! Whats going on? My parents are moving to Florida! Are you kidding? Can you believe it? Its happening! Its finally happening! Im free!! Where are they moving to? Del Boca Vista! Del Boca Vista thats where my parents are gonna live! I know! We could visit together! Every five years! Thats incredible! I know I know and you know *why* theyre moving there? Why? To spite your parents! To spite my parents? Yeah! Your parents are crazy! I know theyre out of their minds! Its fantastic! My parents are moving back too! Beautiful! Im sorry Leos moving back here. Im not ready to go back to Florida. He was getting along so well with that woman what happened? Hello? This is Frank Costanza. What do you want? You think you could keep us out of Florida? Were moving in lock stock and barrel. Were gonna be in the pool. Were gonna be in the clubhouse. Were gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out! Im sorry we cant go back to Florida. I cant believe I didnt push for this sooner. You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. Youll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of. Hello. Hello Jerry? Its your father. Oh hi dad. Listen is it all right if we move in with you for a little while? Sounds of breaking glass Jerry dropped his bottle. What was that? Nothing. A bottle broke. Thats all. What do you mean youre gonna move in here? Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista. But its a big complex. You dont understand you gotta have a buffer zone. All right fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone) What? Theyre not going back to Florida. Theyre moving here. What? Why? Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something. Hey Im sorry you had your buffer zone for many years. Its my turn to live baby. You know what youre doing dont you? Youre killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake. Move back with Lydia? Cmon youre lucky to have anybody. Last week you told me I was in my prime I should be swinging. Swinging? What are you out of your mind? Look at you youre disgusting. Youre bald youre paunchy all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If theres a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off by the way. But shes an anti-Semite. Can you blame her? You dont think he minds us staying here do you? Why would he mind? Were his parents. Oh. Hi Elaine. Hello. Jerrys not here? No. Huh. (pause) Oh my god. What? A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh Im dead. Im going to the doctors in a half an hour. Why? Its a long story. Just a second I have to go to the bathroom. What are you gonna do in there? What am I gonna do in the bathroom? You gotta do me a favor. Elaine I really-- Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld I need your sample. You want my urine? I need a clean urine sample from a woman. I dont know. Oh please Mrs. Seinfeld please? Well what am I gonna do it in? Well one of those glasses. Jerrys glasses? Yeah he wont mind. Cmon youre his mom. Oh I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup? Yeah a coffee cups fine. Or maybe a juice glass. Yes fine fine a juice glass is perfect. This one is kind of scratched. It doesnt matter. Howbout A milk glass. A milk glass a juice glass any glass just pick a glass. Jerry doesnt wash these very well. Mrs. Seinfeld pick a glass! Pick a glass Mrs. Seinfeld! All right I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series Hydra Jet Flow Stockholm Superstream you name it. What do you recommend? What are you looking for? Power man. Power. Like Silkwood. Thats for radiation. Thats right. (pointing to the largest one) Now what is this? Thats the Commando 450 I dont sell that one. What about thi- Well thats what we want the Commando 450. Nah believe me. Its only used in the circus. For elephants. Well pay anything. Weve got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer) What about Jerry? He couldnt handle that hes delicate. Its nice being back at Leos Jerrys place was too small. First Leo breaks up then he goes back. What the hells going on? Who is it? Its the super. Were installing new low-flow showerheads in all the bathrooms. Low flow? I dont like the sound of that. So as a result of your test being free of opium I am reinstating you. Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa? Im afraid I cant take you. What? Why not? Elaine according to your urine analysis youre menopausal. you have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman. But I wanted to see the bushmen. Oh and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis. Well its been a great visit. Jerry Ill tell ya. The first thing Im gonna do when I get back to Florida is take a shower. Well at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldnt bear being away from George. George must be happy about that. You have no idea. Take my swim trunks. I wont need them. What does he want with your swim trunks? Why should they go to waste?!?]
123,7,17,[Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage sighing deeply. Instantly a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise) Jerry! (Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey! (Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerrys expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly) Right.. Oh Im sorry. Uh oh so you saw the show? Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny. (Modest) Oh thanks. (Serious) No no I mean it. Youre very funny. (Blunt) I believe you. Oh anyway let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner. (Grabbing his coat) Oh Im sorry I cant - Im going straight to the airport. Ohh.. thats too bad.. Susan thought wed really get along - I guess because were both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what um.. (Turns around picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry he struggles under the size of it) Its a wedding present. Oh? And Jerry? Be careful with it okay? Be very careful. Uh-huh. George as you may be aware your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista Florida. (Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware. So I was wondering would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor? A billiard parlor? Regulation table the hi-fi maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity.. Well thats.. Elaine! Oh hi Frank. (Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us please. (Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing. (Somewhat stern) Oh the things cancelled. Sit down. (Giving up) Okay.. (Sits George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank did George ever show you that photo? (Confused) What photo? You know the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said Costanza? (Interested) Theres a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him? I didnt talk to anyone - I was just walking by and I saw the sign and I thought George might get a kick out of it. I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin Carlo. Who is that? (Muttering out not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here one brother stayed behind. I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated. So you werent born here? No. Thats why I can never be president.. It always irked me. Thats why even at an early age I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They dont want me I dont want them! I dont know what youre getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas- (Cutting him off) Dont bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo? No I I dont. But.. Well the Maestro might. The Maestro? What Maestro? Hes this guy that I went to Tuscany with. Hes a great guy but I just wouldnt feel comfortable calling him. Really? Why? (Explaining) Because he hasnt called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars. Who? You know the Three Tenors? Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy. (Nodding) The other guy. (Overly nice) Could I take that box for you? Uh.. well you better not. Im supposed to be careful with it. Oh then Ill have to put your bag in the over-head. Oh okay.. There we go. Ohh.. look at this.. What? I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this Well dont press the panic button. Im sure that we can still salvage some sauce.. I dont care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin. (Taking some of Jerrys clothing over to the kitchen) I see.. No you dont see - because Im going on the show this week and this was going to be my bit on the show. Well why dont you do your material? Im out. (Looking up sighs) Well you better get to work. (Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip. Hey buddies. Hey. Hey this is for you. (Taps the gift) Its from.. uh Susans roommate Sally. Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off. (Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerrys clothes with a knife then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing? (Looks up) Im salvaging the sauce. Whats the matter with you? (Eats the bread) (Pleading) Hey hey hey. Come on come on. (Moving out into the living room) Jerry why dont you do a bit on Styrofoam? Like what? Well uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerrys act) What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..? (Confused) Wheres the punchline? Its all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerrys) (Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well this is certainly a crappy gift.. A door mat? Thats what she had me lug up from Memphis?! Pretty chintzy huh? Considering the money she makes.. Shes a big executive for Federal Express. Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didnt she just ship it?! Look its personalized. (Holds it up reading) The Costanzas No no. Forget it. I dont want it. Lets just get rid of it. Well maybe your father would be interested in that. I doubt it. You know what hes doing now? Hes putting a pool table in my old bedroom. (Interested) Oh yeah? Well maybe Ill go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know show him a thing or two.. So whats your game? What do you like to play? Eight ball. No nothing doing. Lets you and me play a game of straight pool.. hmm? You like to gamble Cosmo? Yeah now and then - you know how it is.. Five dollars a game huh? Ill break. Okay. Whats all this? Oh Im just moving in some more of my stuff. (Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff.. (Calling out) Oh I put up my doll collection.. Oh my God! What is that?! (Rushing in) What? What is it? (Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother. George its a doll. I know its a doll but it looks like my mother! (Going back to the living room) Oh get outta here.. Whats going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! Youve been up here three hours! We still havent finished the first game. The first game?! (Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well were still uh learning the subtleties of the table. (To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture.. Oh forget about it. Its not your cousin. (Yelling out) You dont know that! (Estelle leaves slamming the door) Were gonna go see him huh? (Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over.. (Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy. Eleven corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick accidentally crashing it into the window) What is this thing doing here? Oh I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl.. Uh Im sorry I cant do this.. Why? I feel like Im in bed with my mother. Oh stop it. Hey Elaine you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent. (Just making conversation) Oh yeah? Oh its unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist! (Mock enthusiasm) Oh thats dynamite. Hey what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show? Who else is on the show? Uh.. one of the three tenors. (Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?! Uh.. Its not Poverotti.. Its not Domingo.. (Extremely excited) The other guy?! (Nodding) Yeah the other guy. (Screams out in joy) My God! I cant believe the other guys going to be on the show! Why? Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph? Why not? (Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy! Hey you look awful. (Sitting on the sofa) Im on no sleep bro. Problem in the bedroom? (Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it. Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night? (Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses rubbing his eye) Its freakin me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat. I thought you didnt want the doormat. I dont. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow. Sally? (Getting upset) Wait wait a minute - Shes coming to New York? Yeah (Smiling) Susan said youd be excited. Excited? Im gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?! Whos Sally? Susans college roommate. Its because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show. So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. Shell be delighted to talk to you. (While opening a cereal box) I will - dont worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact Ill have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. Itll be really heavy. Lets see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap! Thats sounds pretty juvenile. (Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up smiling) Hey! A dinosaur! His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs maybe I could recognize him. Unfortunately those photographs are at home. Well listen if you bring em by maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah Frank here - hes got his own billiard room. (Trying to concentrate) Yes Its uh its.. uh uh.. What do you call it Kramer? A billiard room. No not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on already. Come on.. (Confused) What? We call it.. the uh.. (Snaps) The Place To Be! The place to be! Yes! Its the place to be. (Agreeing to a game) Ah then I shall be there. And now Gentlemen (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony. Oh yeah? (Noticing the expressions) Ohh my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) Its an old conductors trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein. Really? You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance. Thats good thinking. You see?.. You see?! Well it doesnt look exactly like her. Jerry come on. If my mother keeps shrinking this is exactly what shes gonna look like in ten years! Why dont you just get rid of it? I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator but I couldnt do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll opening the door to leave) Susans so attached to this thing. Wait where are you going? Dont take your dolly and go home. Hi Elaine. Did you see that?! Im just glad its outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) Whats that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying) Oh its a poster of the three tenors. Oh. (Intercom buzzes Jerry answers it) Yeah? (Through the intercom) Its Sally. Oh did you bring the bar-b-que sauce? A whole case. (Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about? (Blunt to the point) No. How come? I told you - Its fantastic. Eh I like mine. Ive had yours Im telling you - this one is ten times better. Dont you believe me? I dont want it. (Slightly confused by her behavior) I dont understand this. Why wouldnt you want to get something thats better if Im telling you its better? And its not a little better - its much better. (Not committing to the conversation) It doesnt matter to me. Come in. (Peppy) Well here I am! Oh hi. Elaine this is Sally. Hi. How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable? (Setting the box down on his table) Actually the seat next to me was empty so there was no problem at all. (Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isnt the sauce that I asked for! Thats right. Its a special gourmet sauce. The Pride of Memphis! (Complaining) No no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin! This is much better. And frankly in Memphis we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke. I know its a joke. Its supposed to be a joke! Now Im going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing! You could just do your material. (Peeved) I dont have any material! (Yelling out) Hes got nothin! Georgie! Dont eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) Why do you eat so fast?! You cant even taste it! (Losing it) Dont tell me how to eat! Youre wearing that shirt? Youve had it for five years already! Why dont you get a new shirt?! (Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him he quickly gets up collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) Cmon lets go. Lets go! (On his way out he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll he sheepishly walks out) (To Ruthie the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods agreeing) Now this is remarkable. Im lounging and yet my pants remain perfectly creased. Its him! (Standing up) Its Carlo Costanza! Come on. Are you sure? Id know him anywhere. Ive seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot. I still say were related. (Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh I love this piece. (Turns it up then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments) Alright come on Frank. Its your shot. (Complaining) I cant make anything.. (Like a professional) Well thats because you dont know how to follow through correctly. Follow through? What do you mean? Right here come on Ill show you.. (Gets behind Frank holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright bring it back slowly.. Its a little unnatural but I think Im getting the hang of it. Oh my God! (Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about. Well have you ever considered writing new material? Well maybe if I didnt have so many people in my apartment all the time Id be able to get some work done. (Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me? (Deeply sarcastic) No. Youre never here. (Reflecting) Boy that doll was really freaky wasnt it? Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show. What? Show the doll - show the picture of Georges mother.. its pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) Im gonna call them. Hello? Hello Susan? Its Jerry. Hi Jerry its Sally! (Disappointed) Oh. Is George there? No but he should be home soon. Uh listen this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her. Is this for your comedy routine? (Obviously resents talking to her) Yes. (Gasps) Dont worry. (Like a detective) Im on the case. (Sighs slightly) I uh think Ill get some air. (Slowly leaves) Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestros baton) Hey the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch fat man I cant miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This tables mine. (A series of Kramers plays are displayed and on the last ball of the game..) You know where its going.. Hey! Is George here? Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the rooms chairs. Whispers) The other guy. Its.. .. you! Its really you! Oh Im such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me? My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster) (As he is signing) Oh thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his Thats a shame face) Well whatever. (To Jerry) Im gonna take this to the Maestro. Hes hes playing at the Queens Convalescent Center. (Joking around) Well thats one hell of a gig. (Turning around he picks up a box labeled Ori-dent) Hey look I got something for you. The Ori-dent! (Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box? Well its a delicate mechanism - It you know needs lots of packaging. (Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing? Well I want to sit down. So? Its a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair then sits down in another. When he sees Elaines staring at him he makes a Tada! gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say Ill see ya. and while shes slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute) (Making his exit he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand) (Coy) Ohh.. thank you Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves) (Holding up a picture) Here take a look at this. (Looking at it) Yeah what is it? Its Carlo. I found him! (Handing the picture back) Youve been cooped up in this room too long. (Yelling out) You never support me! Lets see what George says about this.. Wherere my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves) (Taking his pair off he inspects them) Aw beautiful! Hey there Mr. Hairy legs! (Surprised to see her he gets up) Wheres George? Dont worry I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada! (Complaining) No! Thats the wrong doll! Jerry I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This dolls much funnier. Look it has a little bowtie and a cute little hat.. I think its a riot! (Slow whispering) This is a nightmare. Oh well Ill be watching. (Sets the doll down then crosses her fingers) Dont screw up. (Leaves) My pants! Mr. Seinfeld youre on. Elaine? What a surprise. I know youre very busy but I just wanted to come by and give you this. Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush Ive heard so much about.. No no no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this. Ohh what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor with.. those two other guys. Oh Elaine this is magnifico! Oh well I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.. (Yelling from off-camera) Maestro youre on! Oh Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? Well celebrate. Oh ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster) I want to know why you took my doll out of the house. I just wanted a second opinion. (Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesnt that look like my flesh and blood? Of course your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susans doll. Like George did earlier he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would) Oh stop bothering everybody with that picture. Its ridiculous! (Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! Ill show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here! (Pleading) No Mr. Costanza! No no! (Holding out the head in his hand he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?! (To Susan) I told you it looked like her.. (Sets a gift hes brought down) Carlo! Its me Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) Im your cousin Frank! Arent you Carlo? Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe. (Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)]

(deadpan) That must be some book. Yeah well turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now that works out to two and a half extra days that Im awake per week every week. Which means if I live to be eighty I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years. Just imagine how much more youll accomplish. Oh I got a lot of things in the hopper buddy. I didnt know you had a hopper. (smiling) Oh I got a hopper. A big hopper. Alright people Id like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow to Bob Grossberg whos joining us from Business Affairs. Thanks. Hi everybody.

Ah could you repeat that? (slower and louder) Why dont you handle all the copy-editing? (apologetic) I..Im sorry. What? (louder still) Copy-editing! Eh never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine you do it. Hi Im Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me. (downcast) Oh Im sorry. (smiling) How embarrassing this must be for you. (jocular) You just bought your own dinner.

(irked) Im stuck here editing the stupid catalogue because of stupid Bob Grossberg. Listen there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work he says he cant hear and it all gets dumped on me. You think hes faking? I dont know. But Id like to try that earpiece on see if its real. Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh you have a friend. (to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi. Bob you know what? Im kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?

Ah the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early so you both can get ready. Mr Peterman you... (interrupting) Theres no need to deny it Elaine. I heard every word you said. And I know you wouldnt be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal. (resigned) Of course Mr Peterman. (into phone) Tell em Ill come down and talk to em. Okay bye. (to George) Well that was the Friars Club. Dyou think theyre gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I dont think so! Theyre gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper! (worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket then they just throw it?

(animated) Whatre you talking about?! Shes very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back. (indifferent) Yeah well see. (worked up) Because if she gets it back then youll have no reason to be sour. Youll de-sour right? Ill try and de-sour. (aggravated) Oh thats not good enough! You dont try and de-sour.

Come back with me to the store and well pretend to look at the coat. Thats ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you dont want the coat?

So Who is he? Some friend of his from England. Dont you see?...........Its all a big scam. Youre nuts! How do you know hes not wondering the same thing about you? What dyou mean? What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that youre working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big big savings.... And then when you get ityou know you drop him like a hot potato. Aawwh Please..... Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed. (softly)hmmm....patio furnitures on sale. Excuse me...huh...

Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET Ideally.. Excuse me Id like to return this jacket. Certainly. May I ask why? ........For spite... Spite? Thats right. I dont care for the salesman that sold it to me. I dont think you can return an item for spite. What do you mean? Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way then we could do it for you but Im afraid spite doesnt fit into any of our conditions for a refund Thats ridiculous I want to return it. Whats the difference what the reason is. Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob! ........spite.....(Manager walks over) What seems to be the problem? Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she wont take it back. Thats true. You cant return an item based purely on spite.

126,7,20,[I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls here at the stadium dont offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors...... All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! Youd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army...... Hey Costanza. Whats that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty. Its a calzone sir. A calzone huh. Pass it down here. Lets have a look at at it. I want a little taste. Come on come on. Pass it down here. Thats a good boy. Okay.

So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner? Yeah. Huh. What? No. nothing. Whats with you? Feel this. Wow.Thats hot. Yeah. Its piquing hot. Its fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants. Ill see you later. Oh. All right. You dont know what your missing. Im loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless its straight out of the dryer. So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer. Oh yeah. Its a warm and wonderful feeling Jerry. So what are you doing later? I got a date with Nikki. Oh yeah shes a beauty. Shes also quite bold. Oh bold and beautiful. I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. (phone rings)What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I dont think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something thats there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way. You know a lost and found could be a good idea. Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George? Definitely. All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. Were not running a pawn shop here. Hey Elaine. Hi Jerry! This is Nikki. Hi! Hello. This is Todd Gack. Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr. So what movie are you guys seeing? Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out.

EnjoyBlame it on the Rain There putting in a lost and found because of me. Theres a time limit but still. There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone. Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesnt make a move without me. Its very exciting. With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place. So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they dont notice it whats the point. So you dont make it a habit of giving to the blind. Not bills. So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. Its sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in. Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You cant stop them. Shes like a beautiful Godzilla. Without thousands of fleeing Japanese. Hey buddy. What the hell is all this? I am looking for quarters for the dryer. Why cant you do this on your table? Because I dont have a table. Hey. Hey. So how wasBlame it on the Rain? Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too. Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet? No. We were both in the mood for one. You know Elaine It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends.... Oh is that so. Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet. What are you talking about? Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner If he wanted to ask me out why didnt he just ask me. Because if he doesnt ask you out he doesnt get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole. I dont buy it. So what happened after the movie? Nothing. He walked me home. To the door? Yeah. Thats a date. No its not. But I never walk you home. Thats just because your a jackass. Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up? No no. No no. So how did you leave it with him? I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars. Thats another loop hole. Thats two dates without asking you out. Your crazy! Crazy like a man. Number 49. You know my last name is Costanza. Thats Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisanos! $ 6.50 your change. And I always take care of my Pisanos. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught) Hey! You steal my money!! No no. Thats not what I was trying to do. I know what you try to do. Get out. Dont ever come back ever. I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner. Beautiful. I am starving George. I thought tomorrow maybe wed try a little corn beef. Corn beef. I dont think so. It is a little fatty. How about Chinese? Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisanos. Thats the ticket. I just thought it would be nice. A little variety. No no no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. Theres nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table. Thanks for the dinner. Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry. Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out? What? I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars? Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner. Oh all right. Okay well goodnight. Hey if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere? See what is that? Is that a date? Why cant two people go and do something without it being a date? All right. I am sorry its not a date. No way. So Ill see you Saturday night? All right. Pick you up at 8:00 p.m. Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is? I was got to be 55. Thats right it is. Do you know how fast you were going? A lot faster than that! Step out of the car sir. Okay dokey Can I have your license and registration please? Absolutely. Nikki! Yes. Would you mind bringing the officer the registration? Not at all. I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour. You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100. Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket? All right Nik. Thats it. Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt. You got your shirt in my oven!?! I didnt have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And its more convenient. For both of us. And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees. Whats wrong with your oven? I am baking a pie! Yeah. Yeah. Come on up. You got cigars huh. I got some Cubans for Georges wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell! Oh yeah baby. spit spit. What are these?Perducto de PeruJerry if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming. Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks! You got ripped buddy. I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out. Thats a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey. Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now. so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesnt get his calzones? Whats he going to do? Thats exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function. Why dont you get someone else from the office to go get Pisanos for you? Because before you know it hell be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work. No. I never had a job. I decided to go with the brown one s. (pants) What the hell is this? Kramers cooking up some corduroy. There has got to be some way to get back into Pisanos. Pisanos. Thats the place by the stadium right? Yeah. Youve heard of it? Yeah. Newman raves about it. Its on his mail route. He goes by there everyday. Ill see you guys later. What kind of pie are you cooking? Huckleberry. You certainly are in a bind. Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out. Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I dont care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives. Are you going to help me or not? All right all right. Ill help you but I will except something in return. What? Well for starters I want a calzone of my own..... All right. And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie. Thats a little steep dont you think? You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when hes hungry. All right all right. Do we have a deal? But I have to have them by one oclock. Hes very regiment about his meals. I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha ha ha ha. This is nice. Gack. Party of four. Party of four? Who are we meeting? Mom! Dad! This is Elaine. Hello. Hellllllooooo. Nice meeting you.

(slams door) Newman!! Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba? I did. Well if these arent what you wanted then why did you pay him? Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit. Okay. Kramer! Hey you! Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisanos. What happened to Newman? He called in sick. Oh yeah right its raining. Can you do it?

I here you make a pretty mean calzone. Calzone! Yeah calzone. The best! All right. Lay them on me. Ill take three. Three calzones. Hey. Thats a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor. Hey Todd. Hi. You know Nikki. Yeah sure. Wait. Elaine will settle this. Whats theMstand for in Richard M. Nixon? Milhouse. I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner. Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket. Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this. What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies? Thats all I got. No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You cant pay with this. I told you this is all I got. Then no calzones. What happened? Where have you been? The guy wouldnt give them to me because I wanted to pay in change. What the hell happened to your shirt? He overcooked it. Its ruined. Your clothes smell just like Pisanos. Theres another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him. (on phone) Thats right. Do you want to say it again. Ill say it again. I hadnt had a pimple since I was eighteen and I dont care that you dont believe me or not. And hows this. Your fired. Okay your not. I am just a little hungry. Wheres Costanza with my calzone.

You know if I didnt send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldnt be together. These are terrible. Its like trying to smoke a chicken bone. What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway. I think its Dutch. I got to get going. Where are you going? I... uh....promised Nikki that Id walk her dog for her. But she broke up with you. I know I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldnt say no. It smells like a rubber fire. I said rubber fire. Oh. Did you ever pay Todd for these things? Actually its being taken care of right now. You Gack? Yeah. Heres your money. George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisanos? Because they were heated up there. Heating up your clothes? Thats not a bad idea.]

Yeah you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me it doesnt work. (re-entering) Hey youre not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again are you? No no Im off that. You tried it? Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldnt crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy. (leaving) You two keep an eye on each other? (simultaneous) No problem. You bet. Are you sure you didnt hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it. No I didnt hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh my God look whos here.

(to Newman) Aw thats right we forgot about those. (to Kramer) Thats where my missing soda is. And your crab legs and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking? We ran outta space. Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out. Ah Tony hes good. Yeah hes real good. But hes so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing thats wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him or Im afraid hell yell at me. (offering the artichoke can) Choke? No thank you. (lovingly) Oh yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car. Yeah. So anyway the engines been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up... Theres really nothing wrong on the inside. Well the shift knob is loose. You know about that? No I hadnt noticed. (accusingly) Have you been picking at it? Have I been picking at it? No. You know. Its just wear and tear. (disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see. The engine is really the only thing that needs checking. You been rotating the tires? Try to. (sharp) You dont try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? Try to. Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine thats twice the amount I authorised you to spend. I know Mr Peterman but but but but once I saw them I just couldnt stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard... Well where are they? (ingratiatingly) They should be here today. Uh Mr Wilhelm. (entering the office) Yes George. Hi I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh my assignment. Yes well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenners counting on you you know. Yes yes. Very smooth super smooth. No but I really wanna attack this thing you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started? (confusion) Get started? I dont understand George. Well I was wondering... You mean you havent been to payroll? Payroll? No no I havent done that. Well whats the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now dont let him down! Payroll!! Hello there. Im George Costanza. Yes? Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) Im uh working on the project. What project? Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh big payroll project. Youre gonna have to fill me in. You know what Ill just uh Ill just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) Ill just browse around. (blocking George) Hey wait hey. Excuse me uh you cant come back here.

(spotting possible salvation) You know what I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead give him a call hell tell you what Im doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me. (on phone) Mr Wilhelm uh this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh theres a Costanza here says hes working on some project? (on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well thats quite a project. Alright thank you. (apologetically) Ah Im sorry uh that I doubted you. Whatever you need just uh make yourself at home. So he explained it all to you? Yes he explained it all very clearly. Whatd he tell you? (upset) Look! You were right I was wrong! You dont have to humiliate me about it alright! Damn! Oh Mothers Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mothers Day?! (triumphant) Yessss! Ahaha! Come on Kramer! Wha...? Its the truck Kramer. The truck! Look Newman I told you to let this thing go. No no no no no. Listen to me. Most days the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw Michigan. (interested) Uh-huh. But on the week before holidays we see a surge. On alentines Day we send two trucks. On Christmas four packed to the brim. And tomorrow if history is any guide will see some spillover into a fifth truck. (realisation) Mothers Day. The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck. A free truck? Oh boy that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent. (excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail and the rest is ours! Newman you magnificent bastard you did it! (triumph) Let the collecting begin! So... ...did you go down to payroll? (standing) Yes payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off. (pleased) Well then I guess youll be heading downtown then huh? Oh yeah. Downtown. Definitely. Well Im very interested to see how this thing turns out. (to himself) Yeah you said it.

Just like the song says. The song? Theres your answer. Downtown. (thoughtful) Downtown. The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song? Yeah. You sure he didnt just mention it because you happened to be going downtown? I think he was trying to tell me something like it had some sort of a meaning. Okay so how does it go? When youre alone and life is making you lonely you can always go... ... downtown. Maybe you know some little places to go where they never close... ...downtown. Wait a second. Little places to go where they never close. Whats a little place that never closes? Seven-eleven? Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city. Linger on the sidewalk where the neon lights are pretty. Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area? No thats midtown. The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares just go... ...down town. Thingsll be great when youre... ...downtown. I got nothing Jerry. Nothing.

You know that motor oil youre puttin in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places isnt it? Well I change it so often I mean to come all the way down here... Jerry motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay you put in a low-grade oil you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket. I really wanna... Heres what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But its gonna take a major commitment from you. Youre gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles. How much money is this gonna cost me? (contempt) Huh. I dont understand you. Its your own car were talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You dont know the mileage you dont know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid? The washer fluid is fine. (angry) The washer fluid is not fine! Alright you know what uhm...

128,7,22,[Last week on Seinfeld. Okay thank you. (hangs up the phone) So? Whatd they say? Theyre sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow. What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?! Well I didnt count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead did I? What kind of maniac is this guy? Hes a very special maniac. What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman. I dont know. Why couldnt you take better care of that car?! Well are they here? Mr Peterman uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag. Snag? It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friends car. What does that have to do with my clubs? They happened to be in the back seat at the time. What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident? You know like mechanics pants a shirt that said Tony. Lemme ask you something have you ever seen a case like this before? All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment thinks hesgonna lose the car he panics he does something rash. Im gonna ask you somepersonal questions. Im sorry if I touch a nerve but I think itll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car? Had I been taking...? Well did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that. W-well what does it matter? Its my car I can do whatever I want with it. Not that I would think of doing such things. (making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld well let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you these cases never end up well. Well uh whatever you can do. Thanks. (hesitant) Uh Mr Wilhelm. Uh about the project... Thats what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes Georges hand) You really nailed it. I did? Oh yes I read through it this morning. I couldnt have done it better myself and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George. I dont get it. He assigns it to you you dont do it. Somehow it gets done and now hes telling you what a great job you did. Maybe somebody did it and didnt take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didnt need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it what they did or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I dont care. The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes didnt he dear? You planted the rose bushes dear. I did? Yesterday. You remember. (thinks for a moment) Thats right. (pause) Whats for dinner? We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine? The point is however it got done its done. So any luck with the car? No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesnt cover it. Why not? They dont consider it stolen if you wilfully give the guy the keys. (to George) Hey. Hey. (to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say? Theyre looking. I gotta go. Yhello. Mr Seinfeld? Yeah. Its Detective McMahon... ...Im at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah I think youd better get down here. Yeah okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car. (makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him. Are there golf clubs in the back? We really cant tell. You better bring your service records. Watch where you step. Theres quite a bit of... grease. Detective Jerry Seinfeld is here. How dyou do. Thanks for coming down. (indicating) This is Elaine Benes. (explaining) We used to date but now were just friends. I see. Yeah. Im sorry to make you go through this but we need to make sure. Well whats going on? What is this thing? One of our patrolmen stumbled over this. (horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth) Oh my God! The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap. Oh my God. And we know its a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out. What is that smell? Look at the clutch. Uuh. Excuse me. Whoever did this didnt just dismantle it. I mean they took their time they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe. Uhh Wait a second. Turbo? I didnt have a turbo. Your cars not a turbo? No its a nine-hundred S. (happy) Its a turbo Elaine a turbo! (sobbing happiness) Its a tu-hur-bo. Excuse me did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue? (condolences) Yes maam. (singing) Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans.

(exasperated) Where do I find these guys? How much gas we got? Three quarters of a tank. Thats better than we estimated. (smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better. Maybe we could uh stop for a snack. Ah no thats not in the budget. Yeah well the budget changed you know. I mean it might be a good investment. Thats not a good investment thats a loss. Hey dyou see that car? Looks like Jerrys. Im gonna check out that license plate. Yeah those are New York plates. Is that Jerrys number? I dont know but thats New York and were in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds. Whatre you doing? Im calling Jerry. On what? Brought my phone. (answering phone) Yhello. Yeah hey Jerry whats your licence plate number? Why whats up?

Well I dont know what to do man! Kramer! Stay left. Left left left. Right. Go right!/South! Alright! Alright. Im getting off! Im gonna go on the ramp. I hope you realise what youve done. Youve destroyed our whole venture. This ramp is steep. All my work my planning my genius. All for nought. Alright look were pulling too much weight. Hes getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel. Whatre you doing? (climbing though into the back of the truck) Im gonna get something. Are you crazy? Keep your foot on the gas. Hey! Youre not dumping those bottles back there are you? Hey Kramer those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses. Look out below!! (to himself) With this magnifying glass I feel like a scientist.

A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky. (Interested still looking at the couple) Really? Mm-hmm. You know I have a little thing for Beth Lookner. Well I have to admit Ive always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks making a clicking sound with her tongue) Yeah.. Ive been waitin out their marriage for three years. Yeah me too. Well Ive been waiting out two or three marriages but this is the one I really had my eye on. This car out there is taking up like three parking spaces. Oh (Laughs at Georges misfortune) thats mine. You have a car? Well my friend Elise lent it to me for the week. Shes out of town.

These pants are fallin apart huh? (Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know when I first met you Kramer you used to wear jeans all the time. (Looking over Mickeys shoulder at the script) Yeah well I was a different man then. (Jokingly playing off Kramers statement) With a different body. (Slightly offended) Hey I got the body of a.. taught pre-teen Swedish boy. Ehh I dunno.. Now what are you thinkin? (Getting upset) You think that Im not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what youre sayin? Because if thats what youre sayin Jerry Ill go and Ill buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will!

(His thoughts) Im so nauseous. Shes the worst driver. You know what? On my first road test I hit a dog. (Jerry nods blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No no no it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) Im gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk.

My friend Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night! (Out of it) Huh? Theyre gettin divorced! (Quickly breaks stopping traffic) So now what is our move? What do we do? I dont know but we dont have much time. (Agreeing) Mm. The citys probably teeming with people whove been waiting out that marriage. Right. Its like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action. Yeeah but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time. Their grieving time is a luxury I cant afford. Im calling Beth tonight and if you want a clean shot at David I suggest you do likewise. (Nodding) Yeah yeah..

Ive got it! Were calling just to say Im there for you. (Nodding trying it out) Im there for you. Then after a period of being there for you we slowly remove the two words for you and were just (Makes a ta-da! gesture) there. Hey. Hey remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated. Really? (Realizes) Well you dont think it had anything to do with what I said do you? Whatd you say? You know that that thing about her being too good for him. I mean I was just bein folksy.

Well I just want you to know Im there for you. Course now Im here for you but when im not here for you im there for you. (Laughing) Well where ever you are i appreciate it. So how did this all happen? Well actually it had a lot to do with Georges comment. (stunned) Is that right? I thought maybe i could do better. Maybe maybe Well it wasnt just that i realized after 3 years of marriage that Davids little quirks were getting on my nerves a little. (agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married. Like in the middle of our fight last night he did this thing that he always does where he asks questions to himself aloud. And then answers them. Am I happy Beth left me? Of course not. Do I hope to pick up the pieces and move on? Absolutely Youre gonna pick up the pieces. Just had our third anniversary on April 8th 10th (very sad) right Right (Mad) You know as far as Im concerned this whole thing is Georges fault Well David the thing about George is that hes an idiot. Alright auditioning next is Mickey Abbott (Mickey starts looking around for Kramer and checks his watch) Doing a scene from the Terrance Clifford play Press wounds in Ithaca (stands up) Sorry my scene partner isnt here yet so I guess uh..(Kramer enters and runs into some chairs) Oh Hey sorry Im late.

I guess this is the last place you expected to find yourself. (takes a breath) Well were gonna be here a while so take a seat. (Kramer starts trying to sit down Mickey has his back to him and gets out a pack of cigarettes Mickey then turns around once he has his cigarette to find Kramer struggling to sit down) You know if it hadnt been for that secretary of yours...I said sit down! (Kramer still trying to sit down Mickey throws the pack of cigarettes to the floor) Are you deaf Bradley?! I said sit down! (still trying to sit down says under his breath) Im trying. {hard to make out} (almost starts to laugh) Bradley! (looking to the crowd) Its very important that you sit down (Kramer still trying to sit down) Now for the last time (angry) Try again to Sit Down! (Running at Kramer with his arms in the air) Sit down you big stupid Ape! (Mickey tackles Kramer) Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I dont see why not. Ill tell you that There for you crap was a stroke of genius. Ooooh please. Never mind Ah come on Youre a Genius! Aaalright! Mmmnn Georgie! (confused) What whats going on? Whats going on? Youre the man of the hour Thats whats going on. Right What do you mean? Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em. So it was my comment that broke them up? According to them Ya I feel terrible I cant be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door Elaine begins to stop him) (moving over to block the door) Where are you going? Well I gotta go talk to Beth. Talk to Beth? Well I gotta undo what I did. Youre not undoing anything. Oh yes I am Oh no youre not! (starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way.

(Opens the door to reveal a ruffed up George) George?! Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beths couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.

In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah. Boy that was awkward! I dont mind the cemetery. What were you saying to the Rosses over there anyway? Oh I dont know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. Shes not really dead if we find a way to remember her. What is that? Star Trek II. (identifying it) Wrath of Khan! Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies they wrap him up in a towel and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case. That was a hell of a thing when Spock died... Yeah... Well anyway the uh... the stone is up I paid my respects guess thats it. So its over? I have mourned for three long months! Summer months too! Anybody could grieve in January! Its time for George to start being George again. All right so uh lets do something later. How bout a movie? Yes! Nothing says George like a movie! Movie? Yeah you in? No no no I cant. I got my martial arts class. George is going to the movies! (exits) (to Kramer) So hows your karate class going? (pronouncing it kar-ah-tay) Karate Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony. ...But with punching and kicking. Jerry karate is not here (pointing to the ground). Its here (points to head) and here (points to chest) and here (makes a circle with his hands). Alright I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine. What shes been away? Shes been in Mexico for six weeks. No I really think youre wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day. That was July 4th! Alright Im outta here and when I get back I dont want to see you here (points to kitchen) here (points to living room) or here (makes similar circle with his hands). It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Petermans peso. Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog? Oh tons! Anything you couldnt have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata? (laughs sarcastically) You dont respect my work at all do you? No I dont. So whats been going on around this dump? Hows your fiancee? My what? Jeannie... your fiancee. Oh yeah that. Well... All right. Spill it Jerome. Theres really not that much to tell. (simultaneously) I hate you! See ya. (continuing) No rejection no guilt no remorse. Youve never felt remorse. I know I feel bad about that... I bet your parents were upset huh? Eh. You havent told them yet have you? No. So I pressed through the rushes there below me the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria... Oh for the love of God man! Just tell me what the product is. No washcloths! Well Mr. Peterman Ive got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero. (rubbing his neck) Oh my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist. Are you okay Mr. Peterman? Yes yes. Go on go on go on. Well see its... businessmen taking siestas. You know its the uh the Urban Sombrero. Mr. Peterman? (inhales deeply) I tell you Jerry Im feeling something. Something I havent felt in a long time. Pride? No. Autonomy complete and total autonomy. Well youre your own boss now. I wanna go to a tractor pull. Go ahead. I am staying out all night! Whos stopping you? I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese just bite into it like its an apple. Whatever. Oh God. What? Its Dolores. Who? Mulva. Jerry hi. Hi Dolores. George you remember Dolores? Dolores! Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged. Yes Dolores I did. It didnt work out though Dolores. Oh thats too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya. See ya. Bye Dolores. I thought Mulva hated you. Yeah so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. Ive shown I can go all the way. All the way? Not our all the way their all the way. I got the stink of responsibility on me. Yeah and you were engaged for like a minute I was engaged for a year. You stink worse than I do! Im feeling something else here Jerry! Elaine its Mr. Peterman on the phone. (answers the phone) Hello Mr. Peterman how are you feeling? Elaine Ill be blunt. Im burnt out. Im fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer. What? Well whos gonna do it? What about you? Me? Why me? Why indeed. Mr. Peterman you cant leave. Ive already left Elaine. Im in Burma. Burma? You most likely know it as Myanmar but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him) Mr. Peterman? Where? Burma. Isnt it Myanmar now? Jerry he wants me to run the catalog! Its crazy! I cant be in charge! No certainly not. I mean I cant give people orders! No ones gonna listen to you. I am not qualified to run the catalog! Youre not qualified to work at the catalog. Hey. (notices Elaine) Whats wrong? Oh Peterman ran off to Burma and now he wants me to run the catalog. Where? Myanmar. The discount pharmacy? Well Im just gonna tell him no. I cant run the catalog. Whoa whoa. Cant? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What you dont have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh youre not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Wheres your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look Elaine let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate... Karate? Yeah karate. I had no support. Not from him not from Newman no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent I was terrified. My legs they were like noodles. But then I looked inside and I found my katra. Katra? Yeah your spirit your uh being. The part of you that says Yes I can! Sammy Davis had it. So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> Im dominating the dojo. Im class champion. Well you know I I have watched Peterman run the company. Sure you have. I know how to do it. Pair of pants a stupid story a huge markup. I can do that. You follow your katra and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here. (excitedly) Okay. That kid is gonna be all right. No shes not. Come on Kramer! Hey there. Come on. Moms down in the car. Okay Joey. You guys both have class at the same time? No were in the same class. What do you mean youre in the same class? He almost beat me. Kramer youre fighting children?! Were all at the same skill level Jerry. Hes nine years old! You dont need karate you can just wring his neck! I got carpool. (exits) Thanks for the juice box Mrs. Z. Hey could we stop for ice cream on the way home mom? Mmm I dont know... All right. Yay! *Youre* taking the job? You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No make that six ideas by 4:00. All right lets move move move move move! Are you prepared for kumite? Yes Sansei. Fight stance. Hydjama! Begin! (raising Kramers arm) Winner! Its open! (surprised) Rosses. Hello George. Well uh... come in come come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs) We uh tried to call but the line was busy. Oh. Oh. Yeah sure. Here. Uh sit down. Uh uh cheese there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on) We know the last three months have been hard on you. Oh yes yes yes. Very very hard. And theyve been hard on us too. Its a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children. Yes I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do. Thats why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susans memory. Oh thats wonderful. And of course we want you to be an integral part. Yes inte-- h-how inte-- how integral? Youll be on the board of directors. (feigning excitement) Great great. O-Oh oh oh gosh. You know its just... my duties with the Yankees... Dont worry George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings weekends whenever you have free time. I cant believe this is happening. Well it wouldnt have without your friend Jerrys inspirational words. He said to us Shes not really dead if her shadow is... Uh w-what was it dear? Something about a way a-and a light uh... ha. Who the hell knows? Well whats important is that your relationship with Susan doesnt have to end. So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us? (feigning happiness) The second I see him. Hey. Hey. Hows your day good? Actually yeah. Im meeting Mulva here in a few minutes. So uh... Wrath of Khan huh? Yeah. Was that a beauty or what? What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow? No no no its... Shes not really dead if we find a way to remember her. Thats it. Thats the line... (squirts mustard into Jerrys coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life. (stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem? The Rosses have started up a foundation Jerry and I have to sit on the board of directors. Hey board of directors. Look at you! Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery! Before we go any further Id just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise. Dont you see? Im back in. All because of Wrath of Khan? Yes! Well it was the best of those movies. KHAN! George. George. (taps him on the shoulder) (startled) Oh! Im Wyck Thayer chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation. Wink. (correcting him) Wyck. Wyck. Now as you know the Rosses had considerable monies. Oh. I know they have some monies. They had more than some monies. Many many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding. So if Susan and I had... I mean if the envelopes hadnt uh... then we-- Yes. And now? Not. Its all been endowed to the foundation even this townhouse. This townhouse? This would have been your wedding gift. And now? Not. Not. Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It cant be easy. You know it really cant. So who broke it off? Well thats the thing. It was completely mutual. Oh come on. Everybody knows theres no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth. I am. It was the worlds first. You know when I heard you got engaged I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously theres no growth here. (exits) Well I cant argue with that but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself cursing her) Mulva! (answering) Hello? Please hold for Elaine Benes. Oh I dont believe this. (picking up) Jerry! Hey! Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog. Hows it look? (muffled as shes smoking a cigar) Its a peach. Huh? I say its a peach. Elaine let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual did you believe me? No no no. Its weak. No ones gonna buy it and you shouldnt be selling it. I gotta do some research here. Hey hey. Me. Talking. You know between you and me I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it hes not the doofus. *You* are the doofus. Oh Im the doofus? Yeah. You Jerry are the doofus. You know it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now. Oh well maybe Ill just go down there and thank him in person. Yeah thats what I was thinking. Kramer! Oh hey. What are you doing? Oh well I-I-Im dominating. You never said you were fighting children. Well its not the size of the opponent Elaine its uh the ferocity. This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff? No no. Thats from uh Star Trek III... The Search for Spock. Search... for Spock?! Yeah I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture but for me I always... (pushes him) You doofus! Okay question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable less likable as likable? Lets start over here this time. Same. Are we about through here? I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley. She had a little change of plans. Whats going on? Hey Timmy Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight huh? Now we finish it. Aah! Aah! Mama! (on the phone) Dad I wouldnt eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo. Uh look Elaines here I gotta get going. Oh by the way uh Im not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up) So... did you stop by the dojo? Yep. Hows your confidence level? Shot. Self-esteem? Gone. Doofus? (raises her hand) Yo. All right so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be? What is that? Its the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover. Well nobody sees the... cover. God! What happened to you? Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that? Its the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaines choice. Lets congratulate her. Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof! (pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company! Well then I was way off! Well Ill see ya... (exits) Vaya con dios. (with his forehead in his hands) Man I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later? No hes still stuck at the foundation. You know you oughta go down there and help him out. Hes a widower. Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research) Okay lets see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price. Would I have had access to that? Of course it would have been yours. And now? (anticipating the answer) Not. Hello? Hey Georgie! Im doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your storys the one. My story? Yeah your widower storys tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there? Uh excuse me Wyck. Uh are we uh almost done here? (chuckling) Oh no not even close. (remorsefully) I cant go. What do you mean you cant go? Theres two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese George! Cheese! Okay next item. Susans doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?]
132,8,2,[You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?! Well we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet George? I like uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.) Pardon? (mutters it again) Well you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident. He cleared his throat? Yes! So? He did it right as he said her unfortunate accident. Not getting it. Jerry a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan! Oh help me Rhonda. What time is it? 1:15. Right now? I gotta go meet Pam. Oh the bookstore girl. Hows that goin? Okay. Im just not ga-ga over her. For once Id like to be ga-ga. Wheres Elaine? Shes having Carol Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now? Whats with all these people having babies? Perpetuation of the species. Yeah! Right! By the way just for the record - No I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.) ...but because it comes out of your baby it smells good! Well thats...thats sweet. Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful. Elaine you gotta have a baby! Oh hey you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day... Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already. I really like the city. The citys a toilet. Whens the last time you saw my little Adam? Uh it was in the Hamptons. Oh! I have pictures! No no thats okay its uh... Look at him! Just look at him! So Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day... Do you really think Im wrong about this Wyck guy? You know if you really want to test him out why dont you try the old Jerry Lewis trick? Jerry Lewis? I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting hed purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes hed come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him. Thats pretty paranoid. Yes it is. I like it! I thought you might. Oh hi! Im Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerrys told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well Im supposed to meet Jerry its my day off. I work in a bookstore. Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.) Oh careful! (Jerry enters.) Hi sorry Im late. Thats okay. Kramer let me in. You know if we rush we can still make the movie. Okay. (Touches Kramers hand) It was really nice meeting you. Im in trouble buddy. I just met a woman. Go on. Well shes Jerrys girlfriend. Ah yes. Forbidden love. She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam. Pam. I dont know the woman but she sounds quite fetching. I cant even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.) Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.) She has delicate beauty. Jerry wouldnt know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head. And yet hes my friend. And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe sadly for you that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth. Aw thats beautiful Newman. One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary workaday lives! And you my friend have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess. I thought we were talking about me. Right. Kramer you have to confront Jerry. Confront Jerry? I cant. You must! I wont! You will! Elaine ya gotta have a baby. Ugh. Where are all the poetry magazines? The New Yorker has poetry. Yes. The New Yorker. Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much? Theyre my friends but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent. Cmon you want to have a baby. Why? Because I can? Its the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think youre any better? Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk! I couldnt help overhearing what you were saying. Oh Im sorry. No no I think I agree with you. I mean all this talk about having babies. Yeah like you must procreate. Besides anyone can do it. Oh its been done to death. (smiles) I uh should have a poem very soon now. Are you okay George? No no not really. Ever since Susan passed on I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days Im haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasnt it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.) ...and the stock options for this year look quite uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.) Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.) So Kevin. If I dont want children does that make me a bad humanitarian? Not at all. Cause I mean when you get to know me youll see that Im a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh you got a little uh... Oh I just had two double-fudge sundaes. Oh. Are you alright? Yeah Ill be okay. You know Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage. Well Im sure hell be sharing his next one with Pam. Oh no...that wont last. What do you mean? Hes not ga-ga. Lemme tell you something that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? Its ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken. How long did you leave it up there? Five minutes. What the hell happened here? Play the tape maybe well get a clue. I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright alright. Is that it? Stopped dead. What do you make of it? I dont know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.) Jerry. Uh can we talk? Kinda busy here. Id like to talk to Jerry in private. Why cant I stay? Because it doesnt concern you. Well if it doesnt concern me then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of Georges chair drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.) So whats on your mind? Its Pam. Pam? What about Pam? I love her Jerry! You what? I love her! Is that right? Oh shes uh...shes real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan. What does that mean? Oh and that voice! What about her name? Pam? Oh its a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam! Shes got really nice hair. Oh its incredible. Although I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those. Youve got really specific tastes. Oh I know what I want Jerry. Shes got nice calves. Oh shes a dreamboat. But you dont like her so... Maybe I could youre making some pretty good points. No you cant Jerry. But I might. Oh no you dont. Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon? What...? I think I can! I even like the name! Pam! Huh? Pam! Huh? Pam! Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.) So now he wants her more than ever! Blast! What am I gonna do huh? Dont despair my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I wont allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine. What again with you? Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments. If only I could say things like that around her. Yes... Well I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic squink... Yes! Yes I heard the squink! ...followed by a mysterious...glonk. Its baffling isnt it? Well one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase? They would never tell me Elaine. First of all they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides I dont even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.) That Pam! I am ga-ga over her! Ga-ga? When did that happen? Yesterday. Six-ish. Well maybe we should double. Im pretty ga-ga myself. You just met the guy yesterday. Yeah but we have a common goal. A barren sterile existence that ends when you die? Yeah. And you really believe this guy doesnt want to have kids. Yeah of course. Elaine a guyll say anything to get a woman. Oh please. He wouldnt say that. Elaine I once told a woman that I coined the phrase Pardon my French. I once told a woman that I dont eat cake cause it goes right to my thighs. I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family. With your looks and my words well have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.) Oh hi! Kramer. Hi. How are you? Hi. How are you? Im great. I too am well. I too am well. Do I smell Pantene? Do I smell? Pantene! Uh Pantene. Oh my shampoo. Yeah it is Pantene I got a free sample in with my junk mail. Well there really is no junk-mail...well everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card but... ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards... Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.) What? Uh human. Its...human to be moved by a fragrance. Thats so true. Her bouquet cleaved his hardened... Shell. ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell. Kramer that is so lovely. Its by an unknown 20th-century poet. Oh whats his name? Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase Newman preens proudly.) Elaine youve changed my life. Oh Kevin...you can go on and on about how you dont want kids...and it sounds it sounds really nice but...the truth is I dont know if you mean it or not. I got a vasectomy this morning. Although I have a hunch you mean it. I just came by to tell you - Im really really happy about this relationship. Really happy. Oh. Well thats um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.) Kramer! Hello Newman. Hello Jerry. Hows Pam? Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices hes carrying a Brentanos bookstore bag.) Well ta-ta! (Scampers away.) Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.) Alright Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.) Easy Jerry. Steady. You wouldnt want to lose your cool at a time like this. Why not? Because right now Im the only chance youve got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch and his giggling is choked off.) Cmon. (They exit.) I cant believe Im losing Pam! I know how you feel. For I too have a woman for whom I pine. I thought we were talking about me. Right. Anyway I dont need your help. (Turns to leave.) Oh dont you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane observations? Alright Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer? Well there is a little something you can do for me... Cmon out with it. Its about...Elaine. Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no... You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use! Well I know she doesnt want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.) I thought youd be a little more enthusiastic about it. I know I dont want...(clears her throat)...kids. What was that? Well Kevin maybe I have a little doubt. I mean nothing is a hundred percent. This is! Oh boy I always do this. What? Oh I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it. Really? Oh yeah. Like last summer. Im watchin TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and its sitting in my garage. You know thats weird actually cause Im sort of the same way. I mean once for like no reason I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time... Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids! Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short. Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short. Yeah! Yeah! This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale. When did you build this thing? Yesterday took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends its him.) Now from the time I left the room... Wait thats you? Yeah. I really think the M&M should be you. Alright whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape. And? Okay. Thats what we know. But we already knew that. Well yeah. Just give me some idea of what you think it could be. I dont know if youre ready for it. Please. I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation the likes of which you have never - Hold it hold it! Youre right Im not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds Jerry answers it.) Yeah? Its Pam. Cmon up. (To George) Alright its Pam you gotta get goin. Im not through here Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) Im gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel the more it stinks. (Pam enters George leaves.) What was that? We were just playin. Listen I had a long talk with Kramer today... Uh huh... Well the thing is I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.) Im so happy! My world suddenly has meaning! This is the man you have a crush on? Well I have feelings for both of you. How can you have feelings for him? Were soul mates. Why cant I be a soul mate? Jerry you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children? Children? Who said anything about children? I dont want to have children. There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other peoples property and get away with it. Well let me tell you something about those people. They werent counting on this brain! And this tape recorder. George... Youll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) Thats all there was. And yet it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic squink. A glonk. Someone crying out...Dear God! Lets start with uh...with you Wyck. George Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase which for some reason contained a running tape recorder? Alright then. Weve gotten to the bottom of that. What are you guys doing here? Were getting vasectomies. Why? Im doing it for you. What? Whatd you do to your hair? I cut it. Its a little short. Ythink? What are you doing here? Kevins having his vasectomy reversed. Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain after having a vasectomy of his own and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other and bolt for the door themselves.) ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell. Is that a Keats poem? No its a Newman. Well I gotta run. (Smiles pats his briefcase and exits.) Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan? Oh yeah. I just assumed he murdered her. Of course he killed her. So its not just me then. Alright! Back to business.]
133,8,3,[All right. How bout this one: lets say youre abducted by aliens. Fine. They haul you aboard the mother ship take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo or their circus? I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule. But in the circus you get to ride around in the train see the whole planet! Im wearin a little hat Im jumpin through fire.. Theyre puttin their little alien heads in my mouth.. (resigned) At least its show business.. But in the zoo you know they might put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know get me to mate. What if shes got no interest in you? W--then Im pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship. George why couldnt I use the bathroom in that store? Kramer trust me this is the best bathroom in midtown! (frustrated) Wha?? (dry) He knows. (Anyway) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An a flush like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha! (impressed) Now listen uh. You better not wait. Ill catch you later. You sure? (dry) He knows. Wow. Nice. Why dont you try your engagement story? (considers but got into elevator) Wont work. Are you sure? (wry) He knows. Look. Kevin. I really like you heh heh uh. But um maybe wed be better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich) Friends? Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge. Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an Jerry! (frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again.. You know what happens with these? The rollers they get flat spots on em. (hits button several times and whacks it) Come on lets go. (absently wants to be part of it) Oh yeah--yeah..

(doubtful) I dont know do you have a-- Not bad. Wuh--what does she-- (dry) I put her stats on the back. Pretty impressive--Serious boyfriend 92 to 95. Owns her own car.. Favorite president: James Polk! (ELAINE had echoed: Uh-huh. Yup. during it) Hnn! Let me see that. (hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So howd it go with Kevin? Did you steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky? (laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. Hes fine with it. He really wants to be friends. Why would anybody want a friend. (dread) Uh. Its really not that bad actually. He said hed even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do. I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid.. (still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist but told her this was my fianc&eacute;e.. What? Dont you see. Women like that are like members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this its like Ive already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please! (wry not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin close an now it looks like were gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY) (getting up) Can I keep this? No I need it. (absently leaving with it) Thanks. Hi. Im ah Im here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay.. Im sorry sir there is no Mr. Vandelay here.. (taking out wallet) Well let me. Heh.

Hiii.. Very nice to meet you. Its nice to meet you! She had man-hands. (pause) Man Hands? The hands of a man. Its like a creature out of Greek Mythology I mean she was like part woman part horrible beast. (weary) (Look) would you prefer it if she had no hands at all? Would she have hooks? Do uh do hooks make it more attractive Jerry? Kinda cool lookin.. (getting up to go) Uh.. Listen youre picking me up from my (place tomorrow)-- (leaving too) Yeah. Yeah. Okay Ive got five huge boxes of (buttons). Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands I know who you can call-- (weary) Jerry! Kramer?! Hey buddy! Hey! It--eight oclock in the morning!

He says Hello when he leaves Good bye when he arrives. (pause) Shouldnt he say Bad bye? Isnt that the opposite of Good bye? No. Its still a goodbye. Uh. Does he live underwater? No. Is he black.. Look. Just forget it (already). All right? Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice) Tough day at the office? Just comin in an that phone just wouldnt stop.

(strolls away with his friends) (pause) Thanks. (to JERRY GEORGE and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want.. Elaine I got to have another picture of Gillian. I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket! (Here ya are.) (pause turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy. Elaine? (she turns sighing) Can I come?

Well I ah.. been havin trouble at home and uh.. I mean ah you know Ill work harder nights weekends whatever it takes.. No no I dont think thats going to do it uh. These reports you handed in. Its almost as if you have no business training at all.. I dont know what this is supposed to be! Well Im uh just--tryin to get ahead.. Well Im sorry. Theres just no way that we could keep you on. I dont even really work here! Thats what makes this so difficult. Hi. George. Oh yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fianc&eacute;e back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Heres her picture. (hands her a magazine page) Huh? Ha! Heh. Lets go. Private party. (escorts him out) Who is it? (off-camera) Its Lainey! (unlocks opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her) Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh! Come on in! Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling picks up her bag puts it on a chair thats to the right) Whats up? (friendly) Just reading.. Hey.. Whatre you doing? Eatin olives. Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it? (off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall.

I called the phone company an immediately reported the error. Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it? (off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall. (smiles relieved) Hold on. Kevin! Brought some groceries.

Me want to cry.]
134,8,4,[I wouldnt walk over there. Why not? Its the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb wap! Youve had your last egg sandwich. What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time. Id much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab. No cabs comin in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips prosthetic legs and a monkey to answer the door Im back in business. Much rather take it to the head Like I did in 79. You were livin in the village then right? Dont really remember. (Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green. That is disgusting. You know revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction. Well then youre drivin me wild. I had em done for the big Peterman bash Im throwin. (George enters) Oh why you havin a party? nan I drive my people hard and then I reward them. Like with dogs. Exactly. Party? Yeah. Food? Uh huh. Bar? Yeah. George? Hes gonna show up anyway. George I just dont want you interfering. How could I possibly interfere? Isnt that what Jack Ruby said? (Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic fantastic. (To server) You know Id love to get a jump on the next batch where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) Shes been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla? No thanks. Hi ah My name is George. Anna. I dont recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room? No Im a friend of Elaine Benes. Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves) So... How bout leading us in a toast? Oh sure. Hey guys I wanna make a toast. Um... Heres to us who wish us well and those who dont can go to hell... All right whos dancin? Cmon whos dancin? You want me You want me to get it started? Ill get it started. Whew! (She dances) Sweet Fancy Moses! You get the tickets? Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow. Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up not because of who you are but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody? Kramer do you know what I had to go through to get these? Yeah I know but hes a big fan of the genre. You know Id consider it a personal favor to me. Yeah I guess I do owe you. Uh listen do you want me to stay here until George gets up? No Im okay. Theres no problem really. Im fine. (George enters Kramer exits) How was the party? Food was good. Yeah so I didnt miss anything? Well actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance? Elaine danced? It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music. Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs? What you mean you know about this? For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away. Well sometimes you cant help these people til they hit rock bottom. And by then youve lost interest. Hey you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my fathers car. 68 GTO. What made him get that thing? During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy. Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer) Brodys in. I dont even have the extra ticket yet. Well you better get on the horn. Im tellin you Jerry Im gettin a vibe. If I didnt know better Id say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background) How could that be? Jerry its like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party? No George was there he said he had a great time. Ah its George. I bet you this is somehow George related. Oh what are you talkin about? Hes like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company and the next thing you know the entire staffs infected. Now youre talkin crazy! All right Jerry if thats not what it is you tell me. What is it? (Makes sound) Oh theres my call waiting I gotta get goin. You have a minute to approve some copy? Oh yeah sure sure. So ah did ya have a good time at the party last night? It was a real... kick. Hey did you happen to speak to my friend George? As a matter of fact I did. Ah hah. Well listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him. Why? He seems harmless. Oh hes not. Hes very harmful. Really? Oh trust me. Hes a bad seed. Hes a horrible seed. Hes one of the worst seeds Ive ever seen. And you two are friends? Yeah were good friends. So this Anna called me from out of the blue. Really? I thought you were rebuffed. With extreme prejudice. Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you. No no. Thats just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds shed ever seen. Interesting. She doesnt care for you then a stern warning suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaines made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy. Im the bad boy. Ive never been the bad boy. Youve been the bad employee the bad son the bad friend... Yes ... yes yes The bad fianc&eacute;&Mac226; the bad dinner guest the bad credit risk... Okay the point is made. The bad date the bad sport the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper! Half of show business is here. Theres Brody. Brody! Over here. Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket. Thats quite a feed bag youre workin on there. Its for all of us. Is there a problem? Brody cmon. Hes just kidding. Hes a joke maker. Tell him Jerry. Im a joke maker. All right here we go Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera) (To Kramer) Hey hey what the hell is he doing? Relax he does that all the time. Does what? Hes making a copy of the movie for sale on the street hum? May I see you outside for a moment please? But I want to-- Outside! Hey have you seen Anna? Uh she just went to meet your friend George. To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go? The park why? Dont you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him too! What do you mean hes bootlegging the movie? Well its a perfectly legitimate business. Its not legitimate. Its a business. Where did you meet this guy? Hes a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco-- Kramer. (boom sound) Man were missin the Death Blow! I dont believe this. (They run into theater) You know Im not supposed to be talking to you. No ones putting a gun to your head. Do I uh scare you? No... a little. Nice car. Yeah shes a sweet ride. Is that your orthopedic back pillow? Maybe. Well is it or isnt it? Guess not. (To George) Stay away from her. I didnt do nothin. (To Anna) Get in the car. But... You heard me young lady get in the car. (To George) And you you should know better. I dont want you infecting my staff. Lighten up. Go get em Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay? Uh I got a cramp. Well its no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy. Uh there it goes again. Kramer you gotta drive me home. Hey what is going on over there? Jerry finish shooting the movie for me. Are you nuts? Theres no way Im holding that thing. Jerry if the man is in pain... Yeah well maybe if he didnt lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we wouldve eaten some. Serves him right. (pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy? Okay. Lets everybody just relax. Jerry take the camera. All right Im im takin the camera. (To Brody) Cmon lets go. Oh man... Hey man so how was the rest of Death Blow? How was the rest of Death Blow? Yeah who got the final Death Blow cause I thought that Hawaiian guy he had it comin to him! Kramer you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point! Hes quite a character isnt he? You know he came by here at 3 oclock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind! I got it. Yep. Brody. Come on up. Its Brody. What are you crazy? I dont want to see this guy again. Jerry you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you. What if I didnt do it right? Its your first time. Hell understand. People with guns dont understand. Thats why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings. Hey Brody! Hi. Jerry I have to talk to you about the tape. Yeah. Ive never seen such beautiful work. What? (cont) Youre a genius. The zoom-ins the framing. I was enchanted. Well I did the best I could. I got another project for you. Its a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys but its an arty movie and quite frankly they dont have the sensibility. May I use your phone? Uh yeah. Its under the couch. Look at you! Youve got another gig! Uhh. I dont want another gig! Im not doin this. But you have a gift. Jerry this is not your little comedy act. Were talkin feature films. Were talkin federal crime here. (To Jerry) Ill expect that tape by three oclock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat) Sure do you need a glove? Nah. I pressed through the rushes and there the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing arms akimbo feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh) What? What is so funny? Sorry I got hung up. At Yankee Stadium? This? Its mine. Oh really? Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short stocky slow-witted bald man might wear. Hes not stocky. Who did that? Who did that?!? (laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man thats precious. (eats popcorn) No no no no no no no! What were you thinking when you shot this? Thats fine. Do you even know what this scene is about? Its about a guy buying a loaf of bread. No bread is his soul. Hes trying to buy back a loaf of his soul. Wha? Where? Kramer there is no way youre giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it. Nah nah hes not going to know the difference. I dont care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today there was a kid couldnt have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. Thats who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs because his parent or guardian wont let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted. So youll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer on the tape say Ah man I sat in gum) I have to. But Im gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers? Right here. (Elaine enters) Well I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean we were having so much fun. We were wining we were dining we were dancing. (She starts dancing Kramer flips out) What? (He shows her) This umpf thing. Its dancing. No no. That aint dancing Sally. I dance fine. You stink. (He exits) He doesnt know what hes talkin about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry Im a good dancer right? I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away) Jerry do I stink? All right youre beyond stink. But I really enjoy dancing. And thats not helpin either. Thats why youre havin trouble with your staff not because of George. Its that bad? Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah ah please please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. Ill be right back. I have George Costanza still holding. George hi. I have Anna here. Theres something I wanna say to both of you. Yo Anna. Hi George. Whatre you up to? (Ironing) You dont wanna know. Uh well listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize. What wha whatre you talkin about? Well George I just want you to hear me say to Anna that youre a good and decent person. Pick up the phone Elaine. Pick it up! I never should have given Anna the impression-- Pick it up pick it up! --that youre a bad seed I mean youre a fine seed. Elaine get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone) What? You are ruinin everything. Im trying to help. Why are you being so difficult? Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Thats it. More of that difficult. Im a difficult seed. George I dont have time for this. Uh Anna do you wanna talk to George? Um no I dont think so. No she doesnt want to. Okay bye George. Well see ya. Im a bad man! So wheres the tape? No I didnt shoot this one. Im just scouting the location. I need the tape. Youll get your tape. But heres what Im gonna need. Im gonna need three cameras two on the floor one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin em. I wanna be able to talk to em. Are you out of your mind? Kramer... I know Jerry. Its okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah look Brody. Uh Jerry wants to do the bootleg. Hes dyin to do it. But if you dont make him happy the work suffers. And then nobodys happy. Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street! All right. Thats it I cant work like this. Jerry... Im off the project. (He exits) Jerry! I want the tape. Yeah. Well Im the good boy again. Can you believe that? They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs. Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) Its all over. Eh the whole business has changed. Its all about money now. The sad thing is its the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters) Listen man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody hes a reasonable man but hes insane! Kramer Im not doin this anymore. I dont know what I was thinking. Its illegal its dangerous... Did you say dangerous? Im a bootlegger. Youre a what? Im bootleggin a movie baby! Isnt that illegal? I can do hard time for this one. And community service! Is this your FiberCon? (Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way! Jerry George got arrested. What? Yeah. He went down at the Beackman he tried to lam but they cheesed him. Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah. Brody Im comin up. Whatre we gonna do? Well I ah gotta give him something. Come on wheres that tape I shot? I think thats it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses! Jerry she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters) Wheres the tape? Uh well. It uh... Is that it? Uh yeah yeah. Here it is Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again. Howd it turn out? Uh... great. Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there. Yeah out of nowhere theres this lone dancer who appears to be injured. Yeah its a disturbing image. Yeah so you cry... and when you see the dancing you cry again. (George is crying) Its all right George. Youll just pay a fine and thatll be it. Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters) Anna... Oh Elaine thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything. All right. Well well talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters) Okay wheres my boy? Oh my God. Im sitting at home reading a periodical and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head) Ow! Dad... Who put you up to this was it her? All right. Wait a minute. I think youve got it backwards. My George isnt clever enough to hatch a scheme like this. You got that right. What the hell does that mean? That means whatever the hell you want it to mean. You sayin you want a piece of me? I could drop you like a bag of dirt. You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight) But hes an old man Elaine. Well he wrote the check and I cashed it. (Seeing a street vendor) Hey its the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot. Oh Cry Cry Again I wanna see that. No you dont. You shot Death Blow? Yeah. That was brilliant. Thank you. (They continue walking) You were big. Im still big. Its the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal? Yeah pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while. I wouldnt worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)]
135,8,5,[Well I really miss the Bermuda Triangle. I guess theres not much action down there these days. Oh theres action. Theres plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines. Yeah tell me about it. See what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See that would get the triangle going again. What keeps the water in there? I mean why doesnt it disappear? What would be the point in taking the water? Its gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda? No. It belongs to the British. Lucky krauts. So what do you think about that alien autopsy? Oh thats real. I think so too. The doctor will be with you in a moment. nan Difficult? nan Elaine. You shouldnt be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours. nan Well its its..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly.

I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that? nan They have gotten to know you. nan Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesnt even look at my rash. nan Why dont you find a doctor that doesnt know your difficult. nan Oh come on. Im not difficult. Im easy. nan Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys. nan Listen to me you little shi........ Smile. nan Well Elaine you really didnt have to put on the gown. nan Oh its my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home.

136,8,6,[Well I started out working in mortgage bonds but I just found that so limiting. My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while. Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities best move I ever made. Mentor? You mean your boss. Oh no no no Cynthias just a successful businesswoman whos taken me under her wing. Hmm. So Cynthias your mentor. And Im her prot&eacute;g&eacute;. You must have someone like that. You know who guides you in your career path. Well I like Gabe Kaplan. I still dont understand this. Abby has a mentor? Yes. And the mentor advises the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Is there any money involved? No. So whats in it for the mentor? Respect admiration prestige. Pssh. Would the prot&eacute;g&eacute; pick up stuff for the mentor? I suppose if it was on the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s way to the mentor they might. Laundry? Dry cleaning? Its not a valet its a prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Alright. Listen I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I cant concentrate in my apartment. (checking out Georges textbook) Risk management? Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise. Well what makes them think youre a risk management expert? I guess its on my resume. Hello? Please hold for Elaine Benes. You know what? I cant do this. I cant read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice. So get this book on tape. You cant its a textbook. Hey Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party? Am I going? It was three nights ago. What? Youre kidding I just got this invitation today. Oh I was so excited. Its really a beautiful invitation. Oh it was a lovely affair. Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom? Eddie Sherman. Alright send him up here. You gonna do a little yelling? Im gonna do a little firing. That is so cool can you put me on the speaker? Oh yeah sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break. Hey Copernicus? Eddie Sherman is here. Oh great. Send him in. You wanted to see me? Eddie. Yes um I am so sorry but Im afraid were gonna have to... promote you. So what did you say? Well I called him all the way up to my office so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him. What? What did you-- Copywriter. Hes writing copy? Well it cant be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out. Yowza yowza. Check it out. (reading) Jewish singles night? I expect you both to be there. Im not Jewish. Well neither am I. Well why are you going? Im not Im running it. What are you talking about? Well Lomez he usually runs it but hes in the Everglades. Lomez is Jewish? Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox Jerry. Old school. (reading) At the Knights of Columbus? Yeah Frank Costanza hes getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry you know Im really counting on you to come to this. Kramer you know I-- No Jerry look Im cooking all the food myself. (reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies. Do you like tsimmis? My mentor says the duck is outstanding here. Im not really a duck fan the skin seems sort of human. Oh! Look whos here Cynthia! Hello Abby. Hello. Jerry this is Cynthia Pearlman my mentor. Hello. Hi Jerry nice to finally meet you. Well come join us we could pull up a chair. Great my boyfriends just parking the car. Actually Jerry you No kidding? Kenny Bania. Bania? Hey Jerry!! Hows it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck heres the best. The best Jerry. Excuse me Im sorry to bother you I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that? Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape. I tell ya I am hooked on these books on tape. Oh tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille. Reading for the Blind? I take an eye test; I flunk it the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management. So I finally met the mentor. Whats she like? Impressive? Oh yeah shes dating Bania. Bania? Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen. What did you have? Chicken how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania? Marsala? Piccata if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley. Hey good luck with that. Thank you. Dad. What are you wearing an athletic sweat suit? What are you doing here? Well he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh its gonna be a rager. Kramer how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people? Yeah youre right. Thats a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank you know anybody who can help me cook? Cook? No I dont know any cooks. I dont know anything about cooking! Whats the matter with him? My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened ever since you cant get him near a kitchen. Shell-shocked? Oh yeah but that has nothing to do with it. Thats good work guys. That aught to do it for today. Wait. You didnt ask me about my ideas. Oh Eddie well its your first day. Im ready. Oh okay. (reading) Its a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasnt betrayed you the only friend who wont be dead by sun up. Sleep tight mates in your quilted Chambray nightshirts. What am I gonna do? He is a disaster. Well if hes doing that bad maybe hes in line for another promotion. You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do I should promote him. Ill give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin me out. Nothing at all. Well George your vision is quite impaired. If youll just sign this insurance form heres a pen. Youre a very handsome man by the way. What the hell is going on here? What are you doing? I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newmans I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfinos this is kreplach. Here try some of this. No I dont want to. Eat eat! Youre skin and bones. Hah? Oh this is awful. Jerry its kreplach. Its an acquired taste yeah. Did you follow the recipe? The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused. It tastes like dirt. Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look Im in trouble I got no skills. I cant peel I cant chop I cant grate. I cant mince! I got no sense of flavor obviously. You know I gotta talk to Frank. Kramer you cant talk to Frank. No I gotta talk to him I know that he can help me Jerry. I think theres a dead animal in the elevator. My stuffed cabbage! So great dinner last night. Yeah it was alright. I told Cynthia wed double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act. No. No no way no Bania. What? Have you seen his act? Hes got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. Hes a punk a patsy a hack. Cynthia would not date a hack. Would. Does. Is. Before we get started I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog. Hes upstairs I made him Director of Corporate Development. You promoted him? Well no I would hardly-- I bust my hump ever day. Relax-- As far as Im concerned you and your deranged prot&eacute;g&eacute; can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit! Well hey? Hey. Hey!! Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky? This guy sounds just like me. To understand risk we must first define risk. This is horrible. Risk is defined as-- (banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it! Cmon Frank I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago. In my mind theres a war still going on. Alright what happened Frank? What is it that you cant get over? Inchon Korea 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past but I was arrogant I was brash I thought if I used just the right spices cooked it long enough... What happened? I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys. Frank you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone. Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home! Frank now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again. No. No Ill never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go. So you saw Banias act? He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldnt take it anymore. I told you its like getting beaten with a bag of oranges. Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine? He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny. Anyway Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think its over. No more mentor? Looks that way. Well at least you and I are okay again. Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldnt see each other for a while. Why? Well Im feeling a little disoriented. Its just weird for me not to have an advisor. I can tell you what to do. No its more than that. I can tell you what to think. I need someone I can trust. Oh. I got a big problem here Jerry. The tapes are worthless. Kind of in the middle of something here George. George? I gotta run anyway. I cant believe you feel you really need a mentor. I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. Ill see ya. Yeah see ya. Whats your problem. No problem. Hey I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes. Oh. (reading) Its tough keeping your feet dry when youre kicking in a skull. You know Eddie that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear. Well Im not married to it. Dewy meadow. Heres your omelet. Its dry. Thats the way I always make it. Well it sucks. What did you say? Your meatloaf is mushy your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house! Well thats too bad because Im the only one who cooks around here! Not any more! Gimme that spatula! Im back baby! And youre sure with your busy schedule youd have time to take on a prot&eacute;g&eacute;? Ill make time because Abby I was once like you; wide-eyed naive I didnt know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management. Im not familiar with that youll have to explain it to me. Ill tell you what why dont you read this book and lets just see if you can explain it to me. Alright. Okay. Hey Jerry. Oh hey Bania. Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me. Oh thats too bad. Maybe shes right. Maybe I am a complete hack. Im the absolute worst. The worst Jerry. Well its just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl&eacute;s Quik bit by the time you get to Ovaltine-- You think you can give me a hand with my material? Hey. You still need a cook? Oh yeah come on in Frank. Ya got T-Fal? Keflon. No! Follow me. (reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. Thats gold Jerry! Gold! Lets just replace hail of shrapnel and scar tissue with string of pearls and raspberry scones. George Costanza is your mentor? Yeah hes great! I am learning so much. About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check? You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship. As a matter of fact I happen to have a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of my own. Who? A Mister Kenneth Bania. Bania? Im gonna mentor this kid to the top. Huh well I dont think I want to date a mentor whose prot&eacute;g&eacute; is a hack. Well I dont think I want to date a prot&eacute;g&eacute; whose mentor is a Costanza. I dont know how we did it but theres some kind of chemistry between us we turned out one hell of a catalog. Cool. Hey Ed let me ask you something. Whats with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh? I dont want to talk about it. Come on dont be a baby. I went out on a couple of dates with this woman I thought she really liked me and then things kind of cooled off. Thats it? Well its tough meeting somebody you like let alone somebody Jewish. Mm. This food is fantastic. Have you tried the hamentashen? I cant get off the kishkas. Hey Jerry! Bania? I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? Its killer! Risk management? Aw its gold Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back. So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days? Thats right. How much are they paying you? Ill double it. Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes. Wheres the powdered sugar? You know Frank you could take a break. No breaks. I fell reborn Im like a Phoenix rising from Arizona. Youre quitting? I cant churn out that pointless drivel any more. Well you cant quit youre all Ive got. I need you! Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management. Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine? They should call it round tine. You know what Im talking about. (proudly to the man seated beside him): Hes my prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Noooo!!! Dont eat it! No good!]
137,8,7,[Hey have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC Tagemat HB. Ugh the whole countrys sick to their stomach. Now you know youre supposed to take these things before you get sick? What is this a bit? No. Cos Im not in the mood. Were just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good youre supposed to take one! Yeah I know that tone. This is a bit. Theyve opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well. (tired) Alright are you done with your little amusement? (hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing? It was okay but move the medication for the well to the front and hit the word good harder. (thinking) Great. Thanks. So your firm designed all the furniture in here? We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman. (as if she knows) Oh Farbman. You know Farbman? Mm love Farbman. Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman. Wuh if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha. Wouldnt it be great if Farbman designed shoes? Brett? Dont you think that would be great? Brett? (still staring off) After the song babe. Huh? The song. So when do I meet this jerk? Hes not a jerk Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman. Who? (dismissive) I dunno some designer. Anyway Brett is so generous and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song. What song? Desperado. Desperado? Uh huh. And youre still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado. (pointing toward the guy) See that salesman twirling that umbrella. Uh huh. I invented that. That had to be invented? When I started out as a comedian I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it to attract customers. (skeptical) Oh hoh really? Well why dont we ask him about it? Elaine. Excuse me. Hey how you doing. Uhm my uh friend here says that he invented that little twirl youre doing. Elaine please it was a long time ago. The man doesnt want a history lesson. Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl. (looking at Jerry) Ohh. I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth. Yeah thats where he come up with it. In his dreams. Alright can we (glances at her watch) go? (to Clicky) By the way youre doing it too fast. Youll disorient the customers. Its the twirling that dazzles the eye. (pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans. (as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people. Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching. (taking the envelope) Oh no not more checks. Theyre coming faster than I can sign em. What checks? Oh you didnt hear? Jerrys a big star in Japan. I dont know why. Theres a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show. Yeah the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time and now Im starting to get all these royalty checks. Look at all of those! Youre rich! Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. Its barely worth the pain in my hand to sign em. Hey Jerry you need any new furniture? Why? (getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah well Elaines new boyfriend you know. Hes giving me this oversize chest of drawers. Its a Farbman. Hes giving you furniture? Who is this guy? Ah who are any of her losers? (dryly) Youre on that list. Alright I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know theyre doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars. Oh no no no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners? Yeah you heard of em? Theyre a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment. So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning I can listen to some pointless blather. I do it Im not even getting the cleaning. Signed over a hundred checks this morning. Hello twelve dollars. Excuse me. Would you take picture please? (takes camera) Oh yeah sure. Im gonna ask this guy something. (to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that dont you? (to tourists) Hey are you folks from Japan. Hai. Yes. (points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug? Thats the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour. Ahh Super Terrific Happy... Ah yeah. Yeah thats him. What is he doing? Well I dont know. But something super terrific Im sure. Hes funny. Oh yeah very funny. And it wouldnt be impolite to laugh at his antics. Yeah. Yeah thats it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America. (calling to George) Were pretty much finished. Theres just one more thing. (smiling expectantly) Here it comes. (clears throat) You forgot to sign your check. (signs) Sorry. (expectant) Youre sure uh there isnt anything else? (flat) No. (let down) So thats it? Unless you need a receipt. (melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..Im searching for answers anywhere. (flat) Good luck with that. Hey. Whats with the claw? Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome. (to Elaine) Theres no sign of Kramer. Oh Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry. Hi. Thats very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian. Ah Im one kind. Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer? The Fleckman. Farbman. Right. You gotta see em. Beautiful. (not interested) Oh Im sure they are. Id be happy to get you some if thats what youre driving at. No. Im fine thank you. Dont worry. Its no charge to you. Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits. (quiet annoyance) I dont write skits. (walking back to Elaine) Well of course you dont. You dont have a proper workstation. Ill fax you over my catalogue. Mmm. Brett uhm Jerry doesnt have a fax machine. (quiet) Oops. Well Im sure thingsll pick up for you soon. Elaine maybe we should get going. Oh. Jerry you wanna join us? Oh where you going? The coffee shop? (scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant. You look like you could use a... (warning) Jerry. (reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey Mr Oh how much would these run you in Tokyo? (thinks for a second) Ahh about uh thirty thousand yen. (shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free. Giddyup. Youre a cowboy now. I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. Hes upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers isnt he? Why? Why dyou think hes upset? How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like. (romantic) Were not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night are we? (smiling) I hope not. (surprised) Brett? Everything alright? (worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside? Elaine the song. (relieved) Oh. Oh oh phew. You know for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook whos hanging on the fender... Elaine could you just not talk for one minute? (apologetic silently mouthed) Sorry. No spiel? (annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult! So youre angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you? They couldve at least tried! You know maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed? Please. Too dumb? (impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds. Konichi-wa. Yeah its a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) Theyre known as gift-givers. And tonight were going dancing at the Rainbow Room. Sounds like youre throwing a lot of their money around. Well Jerry theyre Japanese. I mean that TV you watch that sushi you eat I mean even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes hmm? Thats right. Howd you hook up with these guys? Well they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now they get you. What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan? (to George) Alright whatd you do with that pilot you did. (excited) Yeah the pilot! Thats right I think that had marvellous production values. (enthusiastic) And you know I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York! Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed. (animated) It failed here! Because here every time you turn on a TV all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment whining about their dates! George is right Jerry. See here youre just another apple but in Japan youre an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there. You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?! Well why do I need your permission? Because hes my butler. (eager) So? What dyou think? Ah. You see the man who was the butler uh had gotten into a car accident with Jerry and because he didnt have any insurance the judge decreed that the man become Jerrys butler. No. Thats what makes it such a humorous situation. Are you following any of this? Im still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges. Oh I uh I disagree. Youve uh youve been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) Youve forgotten what its like to have no oranges. Again with the oranges (flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb. (positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs) Ah I think Im on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado. (throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station? He is just in his own world when he hears that song. Its like Im sitting there in the car and hes.. out riding fences. You know what you need is a song you can share. Yes. Youre right. We need to find our song. Okay. So is there any song that you feel very strongly about? (points) I like Witchy Woman. Witchy Woman? You know Witchy Woman. (sings) Ooo-ooh wit-chay woman. (getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman. (to Jerry) Hey man. Hey. Hey. How was the Rainbow Room? Uh well we uh we had to leave early. There was a uh slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill. Ah. Uh listen uh can I borrow some pillows? What for? Yeah well uh my Japanese friendsre gonna stay with me. I thought they all had suites at the Plaza? Well Im sorry Jerry we all dont have checks rolling in like you do. Well what about all that money from the kimonos I wear? Well they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen. Fifty thousand yen? Isnt that only a few hundred dollars? Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh by the way tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them. In them?! You have them sleeping in drawers?! Jerry have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time.

But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub. (frantic) Im calling Jerry. Yeah? (panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get em outta the drawers and get em down here or I dont have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV! (kidding) Uncle Leo? (scream) Jerry!! Alright alright. Ill wake em up. (to himself) Hmm testy. Hello? Mr Jerry! Open the drawer please! Its stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood. Pull harder. Im trying. I cant get a grip. My hands had kind of a bad week. Very funny but no joking please. (looks round) Dont worry Ill get you out. Brett believe me. You dont have to do this. Elaine I know hell appreciate this. Granted its not as nice as Kramers cabinet but its start. Uh I promise you Jerry is not jealous of Kramers cabinet. (yell) Move to the back of the drawers! Jerry? Jerry. (shouting) Not the Farbman!! (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldnt let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe. We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced. So uh gentlemen do we have a deal? (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Could we have a couple of those oranges? (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We are very hungry and have survived many hardships. (to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners? Mr Wilhelm? Wha..whatre you doing here? Im here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted.

Please Mr Wilhelm you gotta listen to me! Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya. With these two idiots I dont know how the Yankees won the World Series. (apologetically) Brett Im Im really sorry. I didnt mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe. (defensive) At least it was just the handle! It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell... I cant remember his name! Fleckman? Calm down Brett okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Bretts head and sings) Desperado mmm-mm-mmm. You better... (singing) ...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you before its too... His pulse is fine. Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling. Doctor? (concerned) Doctor? (worried) Doctor?

I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked. No its not debunked its totally bunk. Isnt bunk bad? Like thats a lot of bunk. No something is bunk and then you debunk it. What? Huh? I think. (Pause as they all look down) Look it Im dating a doctor and I like it. Lets just move on. (Phone rings) Hello? Jerry. Oh hi Katie.

I almost passed the last one. Well youre basically a doctor. Right? I mean people do call you doctor. Well um... Well can I introduce you as doctor? Yeah. All right thats all I wanted to know. Mono. (George removes hand) It was fantastic Jerry. We wound up talking all night. So youre enjoying the not enjoying. you know just by conversing you can really learn a lot about a person. Im finding that out. (Kramer enters) Hey buddy. How was career day? Ah I didnt get on. The lizard guy went long. You got bumped from career day? It was a mix-up Im sure. Theyre trying to screw with your head. Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head? Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I dont know. Hey hey. Kramer what are you doing? You cant smoke in here. No come on. (Larry the cook comes over) Take it outside. Come on Larry. You know me. It bothers people and its against the law. You can make all the laws you want hes still gonna bother people. What did they kick you out too? Yeah they kicked us all out. Thanks so much for coming back Jerry. Care for a graham cracker? No lets just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about? Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone! But I was promised this slot. Single file Jerry. (Jerry joins the line) Fire drill can you believe that? What is Pericles? Pericles is correct. Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters) Hey you got any matches? Middle drawer. Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? We were looking for Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Thanks. (Kramer leaves phone rings) Hello? Jerry. Oh hi Katie. I heard what happened to the junior high. They cant bump you like that. That is so unprofessional. Oh relax Katie. Its not a problem. What is Borax? Yes youre right. They bump you in junior high the next thing you know youre being bumped in high schools colleges trade schools. Before you know it Lettermans not returning your calls. (Kramer enters) Ashtrays? No I dont have any ashtrays. Ooh cereal bowls. Jerry now dont freak out Ill take care of it. No Katie dont-- (He hangs up phone) All right thanks. (Kramer leaves) What is Tungsten or Wolfram? We were looking for What is Tungsten or Wolfram. Is this a repeat? No no no. Just lately Ive been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon (To television) what is chicken Kiev (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise. Louise! Thats whats doin it. Youre no longer pre-occupied with sex so your mind is able to focus. You think? Yeah. I mean lets say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay from what I know about you your brain consists of two parts: the intellect represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce) and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise this previously useless lump is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce) Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. Ill see ya. (He throws finished Rubiks cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters) Need some more matches. What is goin on in there? I met some people smoking on the street so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke. Why? Well somebody had to. You know just because a persons a smoker that doesnt mean hes not a human being. It doesnt? Well you can confine them you can punish them you can cram them into the corner but theyre not going away Jerry. All right. Yeah. So when theyre handing you those cadavers do you get to choose whether its a man or a woman? I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man) Oh my God. Whats wrong? Its Sue Ellen Mischke this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face) Elaine? Hi. Oh hi Sue Ellen. Oh Rick this is an old old friend of mine Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giulianis gums. Well this is my boyfriend doctor Ben Gelfen. Well Im an intern. Hey stop kidding me. Hes a doctor. Hes a very good doctor. Carlittos just passed out. Can anyone help? Well theres a doctor right here. No theres not. Cant you at least tell him what to do? Like what? Shouldnt he elevate his legs? Right. Elevate your legs! I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he couldve helped. I thought he was a doctor. Oh he is. Kind of. I mean I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.) Of course. Absolute zero! What? What is with all these books? I stopped having sex. All right Ill see ya Bill. All right I got room for two but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey. Hey. Wh-Whatd you got a smokers lounge in there? Oh yeah people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know they come in once its like theyre addicted. (Katie enters) Jerry oh there you are. You didnt answer the phone. I was out. Oh. Jerry great news. I got you an assembly. An assembly? Two hours in front of the entire junior high grades six through eight. Thats six grade seventh grade-- I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours? And it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James. Superfreak? Yes. What is your answer to number 74? Medobolic acidosis. No! Hypocalimia not medibolic acidosis. Duh! Man Im never gonna pass this thing. Oh yes you are. Well just stop having sex. Guys hitting is not about muscle. Its simple physics. Calculate the velocity v in relation to the trajectory t in which g gravity of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) Its not complicated. Now who are you again? George Costanza assistant to the traveling secretary. Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee? Do you wanna talk about hotels or do you wanna win some ball games? We won the World Series. In six games. ...so if you like to tell jokes and love to make people laugh stand-up comedy may be the career for you. Nine minutes. How am I gonna fill two hours? Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee. And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table) More coffee? Excuse me darling do I detect a Portuguese accent? Si Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor. Mute pragalas senor Eh dont mention it. Portuguese? Yeah my cleaning ladys Portuguese. I mustve picked it up. How come hes gettin so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I dont know no Portuguese? Are you all right? I dont know. Its just the last coupla days my mind has been not good. Wait a second I know whats happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you. What? What are you talking about? To a woman sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street a guy in a jumpsuits gonna come along and pick it up. But now its like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothings getting through. Youre stupid. I dont understand. Exactly. Hey buddy. Hey. Hey you should come over. Tonights pipe night. What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catchers mitt. What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly its crinkly. Its from all that smoke. Youve experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect? Emphysema birth defects cancer. But not this. Jerry my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face. And your teeth your teeth are all brown. Look away Im hideous. Hey Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank. Pooh! Pooh...(laughing) No its Winnie the Pooh. So the hospital called turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know. So what did you do? I told her I would have to think about it. But ultimately youre gonna choose in favor of sex right? I dont know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way. You mean not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances. Simple joke from a simple man. So youre never gonna have sex again? Well Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway. So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what youre gonna say about the Yankees? Oh sports are so pedestrian. Ive prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye. I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks. My vacation was restful splendid magnificent. In fact next time Im plannin on going to Kofu. Oh no. Jackie we gotta talk. No way Kramer. Youve brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out. But Jackie-- I said out. Jackie I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies. The who? The tobacco companies. Ive been wanting a piece of them for years. Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance? No it didnt say anything. So youre a victim. Now your face is shallow unattractive disgusting. So Jackie do you think we gotta case? Your face is my case. How ya doin? Not good. Im a moron. Well dont worry about it. Once he passes the test youll have sex again and youll be fine. Well that kinda brings us to why Im here. You got eleven minutes? What for? Oh come on. I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you. I think it has something to do with me. You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want. (thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No no no. Im sorry its too weird. Oh all right. Is Kramer home? You know Louise. I think youll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry-- George I have to have sex. I used to share that same outlook. But now I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance the atom. Goodbye George. I hate you. (She leaves) What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches) Mas Caf&eacute;? Si por favor. Miss Wilkie your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen into a horrible twisted freak. Who could love me? I disagree. In fact I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity. Rugged? The mans a goblin. Hes only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial hell be nothing more than a shrunken head. All right Mr. Chiles. Youll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day gentlemen. (She exits) Bye-bye. Jackie you did it. Were rich. You better believe it. Jackies cashin in on your wretched disfigurement. Congratulations! You passed! Elaine Elaine. I dont think we should see each other anymore. What? youre breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor? Im sorry Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. Thats the dream of becoming a doctor. Look it are we going to have sex or not? Okay Jerry now when the glee clubs finished singing George goes on then you. (George enters) Hey. Where have you been? You know youre on next. I got lost on the way over. Got lost? We went to school here for three years. What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader. Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise! No the Portuguese waitress. The Portuguese waitress? I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically I had to do it Jerry. George George youre on. No no. Im not going on. Then whatd you come down here for? Tell you about the Portuguese waitress. Its good to have you back. One of you has to go on. All right Ill do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. Whats the deal with homework? youre not working on your home! (Audience boos) It was a great lunch Jackie. Thanks. Its a little puzzling we havent gotten that offer yet. Mrs. Wilkie from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow. A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didnt tell you to have pow-wow. She made an offer. I took it. How much? No no no. There was no money. No money? Then whatd we get? Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it) This is the most public yet of my many humiliations. Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night. Yeah but then you know some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that you were bumped by a lizard? Actually it was a ********. those things deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving like through Mexico. They see one on the road drags him out of the road and chews his face off. Listen well call you if anything opens up. Okay Jimmy? Jerry. Right. Jerry.]
140,8,10,[Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgies moving out! (Gets up) Get out! Im out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine huh. I cant wait for you to see it. (Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine? (Definite) Oh yeah. So its a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya? You know what? its better than Elaines too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone) Shes out. (Stops) Oh right the blind date. Yeah well they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people dont like being associated with all those losers. Come on. Come check out my new place. Itll take you two minutes. I cant. Im meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage. (Gloating) Hey you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles) (Grabs his coat) Oh this is really annoying. (Laughs as they leave) Its working already! (Both exit) (Disgusted) What is with that?! Well its coughing Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air) (Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key? Yeah well uh Newman. Hes - hes got it. You know Kramer I rented out half of my space to you. Yeah and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again) (Picks one up) Mail bags? Hes storing mail in here? (Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently. Excuse me George? (H1) (Looks at her) Yeah uh no menus. (Waves her off) (Moves into the apartment hand out) No Im Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenants association. Oh right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey hey.. I love the floors in here. Its like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball No no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh George unfortunately Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment. (Let down) Yeah but you - you promised it to me. Yes but you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And in light of the terrible suffering that hes already been through weve decided to give it to him. (Depressed) Well.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door leaving) (Correcting) Shipwreck. I remember.. (Leaves) Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) Cancer in labratory animals.. huh. Excuse me Elaine Benes? Yeah? An Alan Mercer called for you. He said hes sorry but he wont be able to make it tonight. (Pause) Hes been stabbed. (Shocked) Stabbed?! More bread? (Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread? That is not the point! The guy was stabbed! Did you find out who stabbed him? Yeah (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend. (Like a father) Well youre not going near this hooligan anymore. Well I dont know.. I mean think about it Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean to be stab-worthy.. You know its.. kind of a compliment. (Sarcastic) Yeah too bad he didnt get shot. He could have been the one. (Coughs) Hey. Hows everybody? (Moves to the kitchen) Hey. Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it then starts coughing directly onto the food) There is now. Kramer you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor. (Shrugging it off) Nah no no no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry then leans in so Elaine cant hear) Plus the botched my vasectimy. (In awe. Whispering) The botched it? (Complaining) Im even more potent now! Hey. Hey. Hows the new place?! Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor.. Andrea Doria? Isnt that the one they did the song about? (Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald. I love Edmund Fitzgeralds voice. (Gives Elaine a look) No Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship. (Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom.. I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat. (Sarcastic) Yeah and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens. (Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue) How do you know? its in my book - Astonishing Tales of the Sea 51 people died. 51 people?! Thats it?! I thought it was like a thousand! There were 1650 survivors. Thats no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food and follows) Oh yeah. I also got Astounding Bear Attacks Hey uh before you go did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there? Yeah oh yeah. Yeah hes not gonna do it. (Leaves) Newman? (Eyes glued to the TV) I guess. Listen I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit. Sometimes we dont get what we want. (Confused) What are you talking about? I didnt get my transfer. Transfer? To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you dont even have to like the stamps.. But its not to be - So Im hanging it up. You quit the post office? Kind of. Im still collecting checks Im just not delivering mail. Well get it out of my storage. Its illegal. And yet its perfectly legal to take a mans soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall. (Cheerfully) Well a laws a law. (Leaves) Ok hold on there.. Thats a nasty cough you got there huh? What cough? I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as shes talking) Im a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alans unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down) No its okay. Im.. still just a little bit jumpy. (Leans in close) Between you and me what happened there with the stabbing? Just.. one of those things you know. What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldnt take it anymore? Or..? I dont know. Could be. Alan?! Carol? (Gets up pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?! (Between screams) No that was a different girl. There was another crazed ex-girlfriend? Right so I called my friend you know - the one who set us up - I found out hes a bad-breaker-upper. Mmm.. Bad how? (Fast) Well you know when you break up how you say things you dont mean? Well he says the mean things you dont mean but he means them. (Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do? Dump him. I cant be with someone who doesnt break up nicely. I mean to me thats one of the most important parts of a relationship. (Agreeing) Whats more important? (Between coughs) Hey. Whats with the dog? (Petting Smuckers) Yeah this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing) Oh.. (Pointing at the dog) Yeah we share the same affliction so Im gonna have a vet check us out. A vet? Oh Ill take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard a chicken a pig a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day. So if I may jump ahead - youre gonna take dog medicine? (Smiling) You bet we are! Huh Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) Ill see ya. Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria. Yes it was a terrifying ordeal. I tell ya I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet thats the real ordeal huh Clarence? (Laughs) (Defensively) We had to abandon ship. Well all vacations have to end eventually. The boat sank. (Holding up Kramers book) According to this it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So uh Clarence how about abandoning this apartment and letting me shove off in this beauty? Is that what this is all about?! I dont think I like you. (Enters his apartment and slams the door behind him) (Yelling out) Its my apartment Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya but I will! Ha ha ha! What are the symptoms? Well uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) Whats worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smuckers coughs) Yeah thats it. Thats it. Yeah well uh - weve been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet? (Offended) What? No. Thats disgusting.. So thats it? Were uh were breakin up? (Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date. (Fast) Ok yeah sure fine right. Whatever you say. (Shows no sign that she cares) Alright good. Good. Ok then well So.. see ya around.. big head. (Gets up to leave) Pardon? You got a big head. Its too big for your body. (Walks for the door) (Laughing out loud) Thats it?! (Laughs again) Thats the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits) So hes keeping the apartment. He doesnt deserve it though! Even if he did suffer that was like 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! Ive been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday! You know if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering maybe you should tell them the Astonishing Tales of Costanza. (Interested) I should! I mean your body of work in this field is unparalleled. I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet! Youre the man! Jerry! Im with people Ill be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newmans face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So you want a protein shake or something? Nah I guess I should really get moving on this huh? Im gonna go. (Opens the door letting Newman in. Leaves) (Angered) Hello.. Newman. (Urgent) I need that mail where is it?! Whats the difference? The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail! Well go ahead. Theres 8 bags of it. Blast! Theres no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! Ill never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerrys couch depressed) Ill be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerrys couch) The dream is dead. Youre giving up that easy? I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya. (Stopping him) No wait a minute Newman! You cant let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too! (Intrigued) What are you proposing? (Fast) Whatever it takes for as long as it takes me where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me! An alliance? (Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves) Hawaii? Thats why youre helping Newman with the mail? (Like an Army general) Elaine Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home Elaine! Where I sleep where I come to play with my toys. Well anyway get this: I spoke to Alan. You know I told him I didnt want to see him anymore.. He called me big head. Big head (Scoffs) Thats almost a compliment. (Agreeing) Its one of the nicest things anyones ever said to me. Hello? (On the other line) Hey. Hey George. Yeah listen I cant make it later. You cant make it? Yeah the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So uh I gotta kinda get ready. Ill see ya. Alright. (Hangs up) Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop? (Saddened) Doesnt look like its gonna happen. (Gives a Thats a shame face) Alright well Ill see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramers coughs then walks off) Kramer arent you taking any medication for that? Yeah yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible. (Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow em. (Gestures to his throat) No my throats too tender. Alright sit down sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog) I dont want to! Cmon. Just sit down! (Squirming) Jerry! What?! Sit down! Sit down! (Struggling) Hey! Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramers head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it! (Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these anyways?! For Smuckers? May cause panting and loss of fur? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills! Whe have the same symptoms. But hes a dog! You need to see a real doctor. No no. No doctors. Alright.. (Heads for the door grabbing his coat) Where are you going? Im taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go? I dont know.. (Opens the door) Cmon you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if hes calling out for a dog) Huh? Cmon! Cmon! Lady could you move your head a little bit? What? Your head. I cant see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) Thank you. I dont see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like hes trying to keep something from Kramer) This isnt the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry scared) Youre taking me to the doctor! So uh Mom Dad I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly.. I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Lets change tables. Get outta here! We have a booth. Frank Im cold! Order a hot dish. Why cant we sit over there? (Points to a table) (Yelling) Thats not a booth! (Trying to match Franks loudness) So who says we have to sit in a booth?! (Loud shouting) I didnt take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table) (Nagging yell) Well I didnt take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant! (Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad. Now George what do you want to know about your childhood? (Fed up with his parents) Actually I think Im pretty clear on it. (Looks up) Wheres that breeze coming from? Kramer outta the car. Out now! No Jerry! Alright thats it.. (Grabs Kramer trying to pull him out of the car) No! Dont! Hey hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer! Just then a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. (Stops then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls) It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw. (Touched) Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanzas testimony. Newman howd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened? Kramer bit me! Bit you?! We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. Im hubbled! I dont think I can do my route - and theyre awarding the transfer in two days! (Bravely) Well what if I deliver it? You?! (Laughs hysterically) You cant deliver mail! Well why not? (Thinks for a moment) I guess youre right. Its just walking around putting it into boxes.. What am I gonna wear? I could give you my uniform from my rookie year. (Excited) I cant believe Im gonna be a mailman! (Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas! Mail on Sunday? (Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street then keeps walking) I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was also infact a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And when I dropped the towel there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to yet another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So there I was with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing these stories have not been embellished because - they need no embellishment. They are simply horrifyingly the story of my life as a short stocky slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that Georges story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave then remembers one more thing..) Oh also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated) Hey Ive been trying to jam stuff in the box like you told me but sometimes it says like Photographs - Do not bend. Do not bend. (Laughs evilly) Just crease crumple cram.. youll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I dont understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment) What? That was the Vice President of the post office. I didnt get the transfer.. They knew it wasnt me doing my route! How did they know?! (Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! Its like the 3-minute mile! (Pleading) I tried my best! Exactly. Youre a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerrys mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerrys coat) You know this is your coat. (Realizing) Damn! (Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really? Its not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down he got into a life boat I mean come on. Boy he didnt know what he was up against. (George laughs) So when do you move into the apartment? Theyre making their decision today. Whats the matter with you? Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down) What giant freak-head? (Annoyed near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. Im a walking candy apple! So its actually gotten to you? Youre playing right into his hands! (Realizing) What? Yeah.. youre right!.. All I have to do is call him up and sit with him and show him that it doesnt bother me. You know laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead. (Casually sarcastic) Either way. (Getting up to leave) Alright. I want to apologize for.. (Shrugging it off) Oh please. So you have a big head. (Casually playing along) So what? It goes well with that bump in your nose. (Suddenly angry) What?! Please! Get help! Theres a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police The Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry! Boy thats some cough you got there. Excuse me uh what are you doing in there? Im moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands) What? Elaines big-head guy? They have you the apartment?! Yeah. Why?! Because you were stabbed and.. got coffee thrown in your face and.. uh.. (Points to Alans bandaged forehead) Oh fork in the forehead. Thats why they gave you the apartment? No I just gave the super 50 bucks. Wait a minute that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery! Tough luck chinless. (Goes into his new apartment and slams the door on George)]
141,8,11,[So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show I waited for you you never came. Im sorry I got really busy. How long did you wait? Five minutes. Five minutes? Thats it? Whats the difference? You never showed up. I couldve! I mean last week we waited for that friend of Kramers for like forty minutes. Well we barely knew the guy. So the longer you know someone the shorter you wait for em. Thats the way it works. When did you tell George to be here? I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been? About five. Thats enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.) Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold. So I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega. How did you know about that? Because Marcelino he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks. He cant do that. Its the only way youll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself. Fantastic day! Fantastic! What happened? (laughs - hehe) Well first Im brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin that must have been lodged in there for days comes loose. Fantastic. Then Im at The Foundation... Youre still doing that? Sometimes once in a while. When you feel guilty. No occasionally Ill forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway they made this large donation to a womens prison and I get to go down there and check it out. Thats caged heat. Yeah-hah! What are you gonna do there? Nothing really you know...just eh stroll around the cell blocks maybe eh take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus? Yes I know I know. I noticed you eh chose the eh clowns with balloons check design. It was a mistake the bank sent me the wrong ones. Hey! Look whos here! Hey Kurt this is Jerry and George and Kramer. Hey Kurt. Taste these eggs. Uh no - I only eat cage-free farm-fresh. Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. Ah I gotta call the office. Honey will you order for me? Im a honey. Hes pretty great huh? Is he from the future? No he just shaves his head. I think its pretty gutsy. Listen sweetheart let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts. What? Clinging to some scraps? These are not scraps. These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair. Oh did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check! Again Im really sorry about the check Marcelino. People seem to like the clowns. Look let me just give you the forty plus another twenty for your trouble. Kay. Arent you going to take the check down? Sorry no. Its store policy. But its your bodega. Even I am not above the policy. Those are our tennis courts. Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights? Theres no fights here Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility. Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in the box? No. This prison stinks. And finally the library which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan our librarian. Nice to meet you. Ill be in my office if you need me. Thanks Warden. Betsy. Betsy. So are you the head of the foundation? Well lets just say it wouldnt exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh shop at the same store (hu)? No its standard issue. Oh my God...Youre in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool! You asked her out? Well...not out. Shes a prisoner. How could you ask her out? Why not? I remember when you wouldnt date that girl who lived in Queens because you didnt want to go over the bridge! That was different! Ill say. Jerry I like being with her. Plus I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in? The pop-in. Yeah no pop-in no in the neighborhood no I saw your light was on. And the best part is if things go really well... Conjugal visit? Dont jinx it! Dont jinx (trails off quietly in elation) Hey. Hey. Whats up? George is dating a convict. Oh? Whats she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge) Embezzlement. Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? Cause mines full. Yeah sure. You dont even have a fridge do you? Well not here. Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.) Kramer Kramer wait a minute what the hell is that? Well its chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerrys fridge.) I sense something is afoot. Yeah I bought a chicken. Allow me. Why? Cage-free farm-fresh eggs. Allow me. What are you an idiot? No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry) Hold it hold it hold it here I got it. Catch. (Tosses his wallet to Elaine she pays the delivery guy.) Hm. (looking at Kurts drivers license photo) Hey drivers license. Oh...my God. What? Your hair. Its so thick and lustrous. I mean it...it was. Well it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked so I kept it. Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.) (sits up in bed) Oh what... Hey. Is that your chicken making all that noise? Oh Jerry loves the morning. Who? Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you. Thanks thats very sweet but that is not a chicken. Of course it is. I picked it out myself. Well you picked out a rooster. Well that would explain Little Jerrys poor egg production. This was fun. Yeah. I had a great time. Five minutes Mr. Costanza. The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.) Ill get that. Oh thanks Bobby. (To Celia) Well I guess Ill see you in four days. Yeah. Go out and have a ball with the guys. Ill be waiting right here for you. Of course you will. (quick chuckle). Youre the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin) Hmm Hello? Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems? Im not having money problems. Enough with the comedy! Youre very clever you should look into advertising. He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone! Im not calling Ed Roydlick. Im doing fine! Thats it. Im gonna to send you fifty dollars. You are NOT sending me fifty dollars! Were sending you fifty dollars! Morty get me an envelope. I swear to God if you send me fifty dollars you are gonna be so sorry! I dont see envelopes! Theyre right in front of you! Oh for heavens sakes... (She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.) Show you... Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh ahhhh (sighs quietly) Howre the folks? Good. So? Movie tonight? I thought you were going out with Celia? I did. Im back. I love this relationship I feel so liberated! Having her in jail. The only thing that bothers me is that Im just coming up with this now. Yeah dating a convicted felon. I dont know how you missed it. Here. (Shows Kurts drivers license to Jerry.) Take a look at that. Huh. Kurts an organ donor. No! Hes not bald. Look! Hes got a full head of hair. So he just shaves his head for no reason? Thats like using a wheelchair for the fun of it! And hes growing it in just for me. (Happily) Its mine. Its all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again) Its just hair. Its not just hair! Look! Its brown. Its chestnut with auburn highlights! So? Youre not around women. You dont know how important a mans hair is. Im sorry George but its true. I knew it. Hey Kramer. Yeah (quietly) Nice rooster. Yeah (again quietly) Whats his name? Ah well this is Little Jerry Seinfeld. Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs) Look cant you take Jerrys check down? Sorry Kramer cant help you. Hey hey Jerry come on. Sorry. I like the way he handles himself. Oh yeah (quietly) Ohhh its coming in already! Yeah (quietly) Wow you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh... What? Well it doesnt seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here. What do you mean? (Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.) Well I dont know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for? About three years. Huh. Oh my God! (Steps into the doorway) Im going bald! George! Im so glad to see you! Hey I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice. Good news - Im up for parole. Parole! (Feigning joy) Thats dynamite! So Marcelinos going to take down the check? Yeah Well it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight. Great! (realizing) What? Well Marcelino he has cockfights in the back of his store. Ah ha... Yeah so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the check comes down. Kramer cockfighting is illegal. Only in The United States. Its inhumane! No Jerry its not what you think it is. Its two roosters peckin at each other! What? Yeah! Well I thought they wore gloves and helmets you know like American Gladiators. No Kramer Little Jerry could get hurt. Yeah well I left him with Marcelino! My Little Jerry! (Runs out.) Hey did you get Little Jerry is he O.K.? Oh well hes more than O.K. he won! You let him fight? Yeah well I couldnt get there in time to stop it but you should have seen Little Jerry Jerry! Flappin his wings and struttin his stuff! He was peckin and weavin and bobbin and talkin trash! He didnt even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds. How long do they usually last? Five seconds. And Marcelino says hes taking your check down today. Great! Hey. Celias up for parole. Hey Little Jerry won his cockfight. What? Who? Im too tired. O.K. listen I want you to come by later alright? Cause were having a victory party for Little Jerry. O.K. (Kramer leaves.) Its over Jerry. Shes gettin out. Ah Im so sorry. Shes been locked up for two years. Shes gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking... In other words a normal relationship. Heh haa. And thats no good. Ive tried it straight Jerry. Weve all seen the results. For me sick is the only way to go. Well shell still be an ex-con. Its not the same. Hey if you two are meant to be together...Im sure the copsll pick her up on something. Kurt? Whats with the sweats? Arent we going out? I dont care. You uh...got a big stain on your shirt. Oh yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich. You already ate? Its from yesterday. Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night. Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal! Now we have a new deal. New deal? When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine the check will be yours. This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit. 85 cents. 85 cents? That is Outrageous! Kramer Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld. Well thats out of the question. But Kramer cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity. Yeah if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight! No no more cockfighting. Lets just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it! You know I think youre jealous. Of what? Yah yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been dont make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was! Kramer give me that rooster! Never! You hate him because hes doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.) George Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled. Well anything I can do to help um...shes a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty. Does she have any plans after shes released? Plans. Schemes. She ah she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends you know - the gang as she likes to call them (chuckles) you know. Yeah theyre eh theyre hatching something you can count on that. Jerry! Tomorrow nights fight-night. Wheres my rooster? Kramer wont sell. Well tell you what Im gonna do. Im gonna take down your check anyway. Oh well thank you Marcelino. Well perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrows main event. You want Little Jerry to take a dive? Shhh not so loud. First of all I dont think you can make a rooster take a dive. Can too! Second of all Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesnt go down for anyone anywhere at anytime! Now Id appreciate it if you please leave. Big Jerry is making a big mistake Jerry. Well see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer whos on the roof.) Kramer Im comin up! We got a cockfight to win! O.K.! Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to. Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. Ive seen a lot of this. Oh God. No no Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. Happy? Why should I be happy? Youve still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurts head with a pen) - then you wont be Kurt anymore. Who will I be? How long do I have? 14 months. Maybe 10. Is there anything I can do? Yes. Live dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (Theres a knock at the door.) Excuse me. Celia? W-w-what are you doing here? Well I didnt get my parole so I busted out. And-and you just decided to pop in...! Kurt! Elaine...(holds out a wedding ring) Will you marry me? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Boy hes lookin good huh Jerry? Yeah. Alright I think thats enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean mean peckin machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that? Im just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry. Hey Kramer...? Be careful. Hey. Hey guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newmans in under thirty seconds! Is that good? I dont know. Where have you been? Celia broke out of prison. Im sitting in my home she shows up at the door! Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in! Yeah. Hey Jerry listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now its like everytime - George this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. (Jerry leaves.) Hey hey Kurt slow down! I cant just marry you whim-bam-boom! I mean I need some fiance-time I need some make-my-girlfriends-jealous time... Plus you want to get to know me. Yeah yeah that too. Well how much time? (sighs Wa-ah) I dont know...a year? No no no...it has to be now. (sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again? So youre actually considering it? Well itll be a couple of years before hes completely bald. Thosell be good times. Marriage is a big step Elaine. Your lifell totally change. Jerry its three-thirty in the morning. Im at a cockfight. What am I clinging to? Oh hey sorry Im late. Hey. Sorry Im late. Wheres Celia? She didnt want to come she-shes not really into sports. hmm. (nodding head) Hey hows he doin? Ohh Hes got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh this came for you express-mail. Its from your parents. Fifty dollars. I Dont Believe This! Theres Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.) Look at the size of his bird! That looks like a dog with a glove on his head. Hi is George back from the cockfight yet? You know I gotta thank him he changed my life. No it must have been a good fight hes not back yet. Ah damn. Aw man! Im not George Costanza. Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K. I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. Hes 68 and 0! Hes a ringer! Wheres the tamale guy? Little Jerrys going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there. Lit _ tle Jer _ ry! Kra _ mer! Stop _ the _ fight! Ta _ mal _ e! Ahhh uh uh uh ohuh aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah ah ah Ah. Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent! They thought I was George. Im not that bald. And I have too little time left to take that kind of crap so I slugged him. So how long are you gonna be in here for? Well my lawyer says 14 months but with good behavior maybe...10? (sighs) So 10 to 14 months. Yeah.]
142,8,12,[Well that was alright huh? Yeah. Well um goodnight. Goodnight. (quietly to himself) Look at this. Jerry we can only stay four days. Well Im upset but well make the most of it. Helen did you pack my travel gym? Yes. (to Jerry) Oh your father bought a exercise device off the television. He does it every morning at four. Only twenty-five minutes a day and you can attach it to any doorknob. Huh. So I guess your travel miles are about to expire. Well actually Jerry we wanted to talk to you about something. Am I finally getting a baby brother? Jerry be serious. How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac? What? The Cadillac I bought for you? Its too much car Jerry. Aw cmon you love that car. What about the Northstar system? I dont think we even use it. Well its a gift and I want you to keep it. We already sold it. Wh..why didnt you tell me before you sold it? Because we had a buyer and we couldnt get a free flight until now. Well we could but we wanted the bulkhead. (exasperated) Ugh. (to Jerry) Man that Emily is wearing me out. Kramer. No no no.

Whatd you get for it? Jack Klompus gave us six grand. You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus? (trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the money. (getting worked up) I dont need the money. Whatre you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega. (animated) Oh is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?! Well also Jerry we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not what it used to be what with def jam and all. Yeah that def jam is a force. Jerry you know I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales executive training program. (sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god. Yknow youve given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah you had some good observations but its over. Now this Bloomingdale thing that could be the next wave. Uh excuse me. Uh pound of Arabian mocha java please. So you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work? Im going to the bathroom. Just very interesting. Yeah when its your money its fascinating.

She treated me to the Arabian mocha java. And you misinterpret this how? Shes stickin it to me that she makes more money than me. Im sure she was just being nice buying you the coffee. No not nice. Shes stickin it to me. Youre crazy. (worked up) Stickin it to me Jerry. George. (angry) Stickin it! So youre buying the car back for your parents? Im flying down to Florida tomorrow. Your parentsll never let you do it. They lied to me about selling the car. Ill lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again. What kind of money you think your parents have? Excuse me? I bet they have more money than mine. Come on your parents have money. You think? When did they ever spend any money? Never. What are their living expenses? Nothing. Where do they ever go on vacation? Nowhere. How much money dyou think they have? Few hundred grand? (excited) Youre saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars is that what youre saying?! Course you may not see it for twenty years. Twenty years? That long? Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day? Fortunately yes. Hows your family history? I have an aunt that died at seven. Really? Aunt Baby. Elaine. Uh you got a moment? Yeah Kramer come on in. I uh need to speak to you about some lady problems. (unsure) Oh-kay. (a little anxious) You know after I have sex with Emily uh I dont want her in the bed any more. Ah. Yeah because shes throwing off my whole sleep. Shes got the jimmy legs. (confused) Jimmy legs? Jimmy leg. (grasping the concept) Ohh. So uh well maybe I should just be honest with her huh? Tell her after sex you just want her outta there? Well Id say it nicely. I dont think so. Well you know I really like this girl and I you know I think if I could just work out this one thing... (interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship. Well youre not exactly zeroing in yourself lady. (pointing to the door angry) Alright get out. (impatient) Get out! So listen I gotta go down to Atlantic City. Im performing at Ballys. You just heard about this today? (pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me. Who cancelled? Carrot Top. I told you my careers fine. I been uh thinking about the family. Tell me uh about Aunt Baby. (looks up to heaven) Shes deceased. (glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm why did she die so young? (looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal. Is that common in our family? Well your uncle Moe he died a young man. Also internal problems. Its that temper on your side. Theyre yelling and yelling and then one day theyre all gone. What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly from the moment I met her! (shouts) Dont you talk about Hennie! I guess you two are the lucky ones. So far. Frank if Aunt Baby were alive today how old would she be? Shed never make it. So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking... Shh shh. (quieter) Well do you? Oh yeah like strawberry pie. Okay but you have a problem sharing a bed with me? I know its not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time Im a zombie. I dont know. (pleading) Aww cmon man. Meet me halfway. Youre not easy Kramer. I know. So to what do I owe the pleasure of this unannounced visit? I wanna buy back the Cadillac. You wanna buy it back? Why you go drugs hidden in the trunk? Im kidding. (reaching into his pocket) Alright Ill give you nine thousand for it. Nine thousand for a Cadillac? Its got no miles on it. You bought it for six! Youre not me. (standing) How much dyou want for it? The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars. Fourteen thousand. Done. But I get to drive it tomorrow because Doris wants to go to Naples. Need a pen? Still works. Hey wheres Jerry? Hes performing at Ballys in Atlantic City. Aw okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah Ballys? Yeah Jerry Seinfelds room please. You know that number? I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well what dyou mean hes not registered? Wha..S E I N V... F. F E L  D. ...F E L D. (half-laughing) Well I think youre wrong. (listens) Alright you have a lucky day too. Hes not there? No they never heard of him. This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner George. (oozing fake sincerity) Well as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about. Wheres Jerry? Oh hell be here. By the way Elaine (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java. George you didnt have to do this. Im president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee. (surprised) President? Yeah. Hey look hes back. I got your message (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City. Jerry Kramer called Ballys. You werent registered. (extemporising) Well I cant stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White. Mom? Dad? Well look whos here. Hello Seinfelds. Wh..whatre you doing here? Were having an upscale dinner. What? Well after talking to you we realised we may not have much time left. So were blowing it all. (holding out his tie) Look George its a Pierre Cardin. That was alright. Yeah. (abruptly) Well Ill see you. Hello. (shouting like theres a bad line) Jerry I had a little mishap with the car. Im down here in alligator alley. You better get down here. (quiet) Huh. Alright. Who was that? (extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Ballys they want me for tonight. So Ill have to repack and go. That didnt sound like the Golden Nugget. Im worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry? Id have to go back to work. Where would you work? Maybe I should talk to Elaine. Well Mr Seinfeld I..Im not sure I understand why you want a job here. Whats not to understand? Well for one thing you live in Florida. Im very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone we have a Kinkos nearby. You know I think that my resume speaks for itself. (looking around her desk) Where is your resume? I dont have it. Ill mail you one. Alright Mr Seinfeld I... What kind of position did you have in mind? You sell clothes here dont you? Yeah. Well I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years. In nineteen forty-nine... (interrupting) Alright. Alright alright. You come in tomorrow well find something for you to do. You wont regret this Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up at four I could be here as early as four twenty-five. Uhm... (upbeat) Oh Elaine this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest ham. (stunned) Mr Peterman. Youre back. Whos Mr Fancy? (hesitant) I uh I was thinking maybe I should spend the night. Aww thats sweet but actually I I think Id prefer it if you left. (surprise) What? You were completely right. I sleep so much better when Im alone. (pause) And you scream in your sleep. I do? (fearful) There was a man he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes. Cmon it was probably the wind. No no no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen you gotta let me sleep here huh? Yknow Ill stay here on my side and Ill stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) Cos I dont wanna sleep alone. (adamant) Well I do. What took you so long? I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened? This thing is a is a behemoth. What did you do? I was I was making a a simple lane change. I I put on the blinker and it took off on me. And the next thing you know I was submerged. Im telling you Jerry Im very lucky that those crocs didnt get me. (exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents. (shrugging) Do whatever you want. Its your car. My car? You drove it into the swamp! It drove itself into the swamp! Besides I think I lost my pen too. (smiling with pleasure) You know that almost makes this all worthwhile. (pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house? Thats your mothers new car. You bought that? Its a Coupe de Elegance. Your father wanted a Mercedes but I wont ride in a German car. Mornin. Oh boy. What the hell is going on here? I had some trouble at my place so I need a little company at night to sleep. George your mother and I and Kramer (holds Kramers hand) have been talking. (dread) Oh god. Uh George your parents cant blow through their savings in this community. Its low-rent. Now we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be. (claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld like that. Wait a minute. (astonished) Youre thinking of moving to Florida again?! Well its either that or we stay here near you and just sit on the money. What do you think we should do Georgie? So anyway effective immediately Miss Benes will return to her old position at her original salary... ...and I of course will return to mine. Kudos Elaine on a job... done. (hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options? I think not. Now down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a diaphanous rum-runner scarf. Well we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories for about a thousand dollars a bolt. (shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on Forty-third Street wholl do it for half that. (tactful) Its ah Asian-Americans. What? (puzzled) Who are you? Dont worry I... Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman. Okay Mr Seinfeld this is not the t... Elaine did you hire this man? (worried) No no. Well I mean you know hes more like an intern you know at best. So if your parents move to Florida youre poor. (pointing out the positive) But happy. Obviously. And if they stay youre rich but... Obviously. Quite a dilemma. You know I have a bit of a dilemma of my own. No no. No no no. (determined) Were staying on me. We havent solved anything yet. Alright this is easy. Let em go. What dyou mean let em go? Theyre spending all my money. Alright well then they stay. Lemma ask you something... (upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerrys gone you could humour me. He humours me. Speaking of Jerry his father is driving me so crazy down at Petermans. You know what I do at the Yankees when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck? What? You schedule a late meeting. (puzzlement) Huh? What does that do? These old guys theyre up at 4 a.m. by two thirty theyre wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?! (grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split. (shouted after Elaine) You know I got nothing outta this! Hey Frank you got two beds in here. Thats right. Thats me on the left. So you sleep in separate beds. Thirty years ago we came to an agreement. It was the only way I could get some rest. (intrigued) Really? (confidential) Estelles got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms. You can get that in your arms? Like you wouldnt believe. Jerry its getting late. Youve cleaned up the car. Youve made all your phone calls. Why are you still here? Well I uh maxed out my credit cards and I dont have enough cash for a hotel room. So... You are uh thinking of staying here? Well... (laughing) Youve got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that death-trap of yours and now you ask me for a favour! You didnt like that crack about the pen. I did not. Well Ive given this a lot of thought and Ive gotta say... (attempting sincerity) As much as Id like to see the two of you living it up in a warm tropical setting I I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So Ive decided I want you to stay. Its too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. Were leaving tonight. (crestfallen) But you said it was my call. We were just being nice. (motherly concern) Cosmo are you sure youre gonna be alright here alone? Oh yeah yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight. (animated) Youre letting him have a woman over?! Hes not family. Its different psychologically. And so I made an explosive out of chick peas and I stopped that great rhino right in his tracks. Well its getting kinda late why dont we uh... Mr Peterman that cant have been the only time that you faced mortal danger. (smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask Elaine. Look if were gonna stay here until all hours of the night can we at least get some food here? (looks at his watch) Its only five fifteen. So later on that same day I developed a great hankering for some wild honey... (standing) Okay Im done. Ill be back in the morning when hes close to finish with his story. Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes. Cheap fabric and dim lighting. Thats how you move merchandise. (winks) Morty youre out. (unconcerned) Ach I never knew what the hell I was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book anyway. I dont know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzers. (not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head. (dismissive) Yeah. (still reading) Dont forget were eating dinner at the Feinermans tomorrow night. (moody) Oh why do I have to go? Theyre your friends. You like em. Ive had it with em. Then we wont go. (yielding) Okay okay. What time? Eight thirty. (satisfied) Ahh. That was alright. One bright note in todays market was the stock of retailer J Peterman whose founders surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points. Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means if you still had those stock options... (downcast) Yeah. (Jerry-style) Thats a shame. (sharp) What are you sticking it to me? (innocent) What? I think youre sticking it to me. Elaine Im sure George is just being sympathetic. (leaning forward and accusing) Stickin it! Youre not alone. Im practically broke. Really? No. But I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac. (relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious. Well you seem happy. I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) Im basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) Nother piece of pie here! So were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac? Actually I havent heard from em yet. Hmm. When are we gonna tell Jerry? I dont wanna worry him. Well tell him next time we go up. He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? Hes not getting away with that. Besides that condo was too much house. How many times can you check the car? (coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the other day. Why would someone break into a car to take a nap? They dont nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there! (shouts) Youre driving me crazy! (standing) Thats it were going back to Queens. (claps hands) Wheres my hat? (shouts) Nooh!]
143,8,13,[Well if the big man wants a new scoreboard I dont wanna be the one to tell him no. No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there. (through a mouthful of shrimp) Well why dont we just put a monitor in his skybox? Hey George the ocean called. Theyre running outta shrimp. (angry to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! Thats what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit! The ocean called Theyre running outta shrimp? Yeah yeah yeah. But then I said to him Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called and theyre running outta you. (smiling) Really? Thats great. You said that to him? (confessing) Well actually I thought it up on the way over here. Oh.

(indicates Gene shelf) Ive seen all these so I went with a Kramer pick. (reading) The Other Side Of Darkness. Huh I never heard of that one. Yeah went straight to video. (positive) That makes me the premiere. (gets Kramers point) Hah. Jerry have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness? No. Its about this woman in a coma. Well I couldnt finish watching it so I want you to read this. (reading) I Cosmo Kramer having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support feeding machine lung-blower etcetera etcetera etcetera. Can you do that for me buddy? Well I dont if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document. Well Im gonna type it up. Yes well of course but even so you may wanna talk to a lawyer. Yeah but Jackie Chiles he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) Im not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldnt even give him his Christmas present. Oh hey new racquet huh? Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasnt gonna get it but this guy Milos who runs the pro shop he really recommended it. In fact its the only racquet he plays with. (picking up Jerrys old racquet) Well youre not gonna need this any more. (accusingly) Hey this is the zee page of my address book. (explaining) Oh yeah I put all your zees on the weights and measures page. (emotional) Oh. Oh bravo Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs) What? Did you enjoy the movie? Who is it? Its Vincent. Of Vincents picks? The same. He called you? He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for like two hours. To a guy youve never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous. Trying to meet him. Hes never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours. Little help hey! (tossing the ball back) Yeah. Thank you. (laughing to Jerry) Oh god that guys terrible. (pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm. Hey how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club? George used up all my guest passes already. Ah. Ahh. Come on. Thank you. (tossing the ball) Here you go. (disbelief) Milos? (shock) Oh hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing? Okay we should uh wrap it up here. So he was bad. What dyou care? Elaine I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet because he said its the only one he plays with. He couldve played just as well with a log. Hey. Right I talked to this lawyer guy Shellbach. Now hes gonna set me up but you gotta come with me and be the executor. The executor? Of what? Kramer wants to die with dignity. Theres a feather in your cap. I dont wanna be a vegetable Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers) Sometimes in life the gods smile upon you my friends. Dyou get someone to take that Canadian quarter? I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience and I bet I can get him to try that line again. Whos Reilly? George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting and this guy says Hey George the ocean called. Theyre running outta shrimp. Listen to the comeback. (pleased) Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. Theyre running outta you. (worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?! How bout this one? How bout Your cranium called. Its got some space to rent.? (confused) What does that mean?

Thatll kill him. (shouting) Im not looking for another line. I got the line. Look George just think about it. You know youre married how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se... (really animated) Alright alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions and it all gets homogenised and you lose the whole edge of it. Im going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess! (picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage? Yeah its still got some spring in the strings. Oh Jerry this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will? (indicating) You see? You cant let go. Trust me Kramer. Given the legal opportunity I will kill you. I wish I could believe you. Hey Elaine do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon? Me? Yeah because youre perfect. Youre a calculating cold-hearted businesswoman. And when theres dirty work to be done you dont mind stomping on a few throats. (smiling flattered) Oh ho cmon. Situation number four. Youre breathing on your own youre conscious but with no muscular function. Well would I be able to communicate? I dont see how. Ach I dont like the sound of this one. Huhh yeah lets pull the cord. Yank it like (pops open soda can) youre starting a mower. Moving on. You have liver kidneys and gall bladder but no central nervous system. Well I gotta have a central nervous system. Okay.

(to Elaine) Cos I could still go to the coffee shop. (points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) Thats right. Hello Milos. Jerry thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down here. Uhm listen... (animated) You know I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about. I..I... You cant even play. Believe me it is Milos great shame. But Jerry I could lose my business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the club? Free. No charge. You could do that? Jerry for you anything. (indicating the woman) Game set and match huh Milos? (apologetic) Hah Jerry I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at all. I refund your money. (animated) You know what Milos I dont even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I... Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you. (doubtful) Yeah youll make it up to me. Tennis anyone? Oh this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) An old woman experiences pain and yearning. A hundred and ninety-two minutes? Thats a lotta yearning huh? You know these movies are great but theyre just so emotionally exhausting. Yeah well what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx. Really? (looking at Gene rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh here look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now thats an hilarious premise. (laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well... Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernies II box) Yeah I could use a chuckle. (approving) Yeah. Whatre you getting? Nothing Im gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness. Oh. How much you got left? Yeah about two hours. Yeah she shot in that coma pretty quick. (at TV screen) Bernie is dead you moron! (frustration) Just because hes wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh how long is this weekend anyway? (reads from label) Ugh! Hello. (accusing) Hows the movie. Elaine? Vincent? (betrayed) The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we had something special. (defensive) No it doesnt mean anything. Im not even gonna rewind it. Vincent? Alright lets get to it. Wha..wait a minute wha..what about Reilly? Reilly doesnt work here any more. (surprise) What? I..I didnt hear about that. Oh we only wake you up for the important meetings. Hello. Hello. Didnt I see you at the pro shop yesterday? I think so. Im Patty. Milos gave me your address. I hope you dont mind me waiting for you here. (to himself) Hoh that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh what shall we do uhm care for a cup of coffee? Why dont we just go up to your apartment? (surprised) Alright. (to himself) Gotta be an easier way. Doctor hows her coma? Oh exactly the same. Wait a minute shes coming out of the coma. Mrs Allbright can you hear me? Are you okay? (bright and cheerful) I feel so rested and refreshed. Get me a toothbrush. So you play tennis? (putting the glass down on the counter) Enough talk Jerry. Not for me I love chatting. (putting her hand to Jerrys face) Shh. (anguished) No! No I cant do this. (moving away) I cant go through with it. (sitting on the couch) Not even for him! Who? (cries) Milos. My husband! (shocked) Your husband?! So concerned was he that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola? (explanation) Hes new around here. (hopeful) So details? (walking away) Well I didnt sleep with her. Because of society right? (weary) Yes George because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out? Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that? Ah youre better off. Now you can just let it go. Yeah Im gonna let it go. You never really had the right comeback anyway. (animated) Are you insane? Jerk store woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him I say. Hey. Oh Jerry listen uh you know I saw the rest of that movie The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end. (frustrated) Ohh I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot. I didnt know it was possible to come out of a coma. I didnt know it was possible not to know that. (from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband? (shouting back) Oh unforgettable. (disappointed) Oww. (nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Yknow shes gonna pull my plug. What? Betrayed? Oh Vincent Im so sorry. I... Yeah listen uh Elaine Ive changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah I decided Im up for it. Kramer do you have any idea what youve done? Excuse me. Whatre you doing? Wha..wha...? Vincent stopped making picks. (upset) Well how am I gonna know what movies to see? We have a wide variety of Gene picks. (dismissive) Genes trash. Im Gene. (forcing a smile) Hi. Milos I can assure you I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing. (not cheered) Thank you but unfortunately I have much larger problems to fry. My wife she has no respect for Milos anymore. I guess thats a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade. Patty she she loves tennis as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would you wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show her I am still a man. (reluctant) Well Ill do it as long as theres no other girls around. I mean I wanna be a man too. So you hurt Vincents feelings? (handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today. (taking the envelope) Wh..Whats this? Its the play button off his VCR. (examining the button) Boy look how far back it goes. Its like a tooth. (sitting) So guess where Mr Ocean phoned turned up? Hes working for Firestone in Akron Ohio. Ohio? Yep. Im leaving first thing tomorrow morning. (nonplused) Youre flying to Akron just to zing a guy? Dont you understand? Its not about him. To have a line as perfect as jerk store and to never use it. I I couldnt live with myself. See there are no jerk stores. It..its just a little confusing is all. (adamant) Its smart. Its a smart line and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And Im not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience! (waving apologetically) Not you. Oh brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain. Hello. Elaine? Its Vincent. (surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you. No. I cant bear to have anyone see me. Vincent listen I wont judge you the way everyone else does. Youre youre strange and beautiful and sensitive. (blunter) Now lets have a look at you. (relenting) Alright but can you bring me few things from the store? I havent been out in a while. (indicating that cars should pass him) Well go around you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed. Hi can I help you? Oh yeah yeah. Im Cosmo Kramer. Yeah I had an appointment to annul my living will. Oh. (looks at her watch) Mr Kramer you had a ten-thirty appointment. Its two oclock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. Hes gone for the day. Too good. (triumphant shout) Another game for Milos!! Hahaha! Youre on fire today. (shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. Hes awful! (milking it) Hes not a man this Jerry. Hes not even married like I am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu. (quietly) Hey uh Milos I dont mind rolling over here but could you lighten up on the not a man stuff? (shouting) Hey everybody look! The little chicken girl wants me to ease up.

(pointing and shouting) Look at the big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. (to Jerry) Hey big baby are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to be changed. (laughter) Hahah. (quietly) I told you to cut it out. (quietly to Jerry) Hey cmon whatre you doing? (to his audience) (waving) Shellbach. Racquet. So George. Youre proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium? (through a mouthful) Long as they dont throw em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp I brought enough for everybody. (doubtful) I have to say this this proposal doesnt make a whole lot of sense. Well you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Lets see how many I can fit in my mouth. (leaning forward) You know George... The ocean called. Theyre running outta shrimp. (standing) Oh yeah Reilly? (smugly) Well the jerk store called. Theyre running outta you (unperturbed) Whats the difference?

See Van Buren he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy! (Sees a pay phone) Oh Jerry can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages.. (She meets up with two of her friends on the way to the phone) Oh Melissa! Kim! Ellen. Hey! You guys I want you to meet Jerry. (Gestures tward Jerry then goes back to the phone) Ohh weve heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It is so sweet of you to take her out. Yeah you dont even know how much she needs this. (Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up? (Casually) No. See ya! Any messages? Yeah no one called. They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her. So shes the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this then shakes it off) There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group. Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath? No Im being as superficial as I possibly can! (Changing subject) Hey I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship. Yeah? Im interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V.. Is he smart? (Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesnt prove anything. And get this: hes into architecture. Hey! Just like you pretend to be. Yes. With a little guidance Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be only for real. Thats my dream Jerry. I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me! Mister Peterman thanks for having me over. Your place isnt quite what I imagined.. (Its plain with no sign of Petermans personality) Ohhh.. Its just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner) Well (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances? Oh Elaine weve covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life. Oh. (Turns on the T.V and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them. Well Mister Peterman do you want to um.. (Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS.. get um started.. 3.. I dont know what that is.. wheres my damn preview channel? (After observing Petermans home life) Well I - I got ta tell you Mister Peterman.. I dont think I see a whole book here. well Im sure well come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzos? You know a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys? (Interested) You dont say. Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign. Well thats pretty exciting. (Pause) Lets put that in the book. But that didnt happen to you. So we pay off your friend and it becomes a Peterman. No I - I really dont think you can do that. (Looking at his dying plant) Ohh damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. Ill bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box) You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend. Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday? No this is brand new. Do you like it? Actually yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?! (Laughs) No Jerry the waitress game be another one. I guess thats all right. Is something wrong Jerry? No absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) Youre fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys! Hey. (Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer George this is Ellen. Ladies and gentlemen this (Opens the door Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off not falling behind. George the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic. Im sure were all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests.. These arent standardized tests - these are his grades. Besides Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect. Is that right? Actually maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher. (Laughs) Steven nothing is higher than an architect. I think Id really like to be a city planner. (Sits down addressing the entire foundation board) Why limit myself to just one building when I can design a whole city? Well thats a good point. (Mutters) No its not. Well isnt an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members) (Irritated) Its called a T-square. You know the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations young man. (Shakes Stevens hand) Thank you. Susan would be proud of what youre doing. Thank you. And they made it their sign because Van Buren our 8th President was the man they most admired. (Laughs) Kramer my friend that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check) You know if you like that one I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue) No uh Kramer. I dont think - (Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot? My whole lot? Name your price man! (Thinks) 1500 dollars. Ill give you half that. (Excited) Done! Kramer my friend (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal. Okay.. (To Elaine) Well I Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back and covers her head in misfortune) Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?! Well Im on the phone with Bob and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So Im off to the store. What happened to Bob Saccamano? Well nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So Im waiting for the subway Its not coming so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel. Alright well now thats something.. Well I dont know if I lost track of time - or what but the next think I knew.. (Adding) A train is bearing down on you?! No I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return. (Reflects on the story) I dont understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning? Well I guess I was.. (Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back? Elaine are you listening?! I didnt even get there! (Pauses) All right next story.. Alright I think I got enough for one day. Yeah yeah chew on that. (Mocking) Yeah Ill chew on that. Oh hey listen by the way - Im hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn.. Oh thanks. Ive got plans. Elaine you should be there to document it. (Putting on her coat) Oh youre getting together with some of your jackass friends and you want me to take notes? Yeah but get there after nine. You know give the poeple a chance to loosen up. So youre denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner? I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if theres one person you should be able to hold down its your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my fathers father before him. You know maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings he answers it) Hello. Oh Hi Ellen. Yeah I called the hotel.. were all set for the weekend. Youre spending the weekend with Ellen? (To George in a cha-ching! motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up goes go Kramers door and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I cant wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerrys apartment confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this? (To Kramer) You want to start? (To George) Uh No no no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together. Jerry this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough. What?! (Adding) Jerry shes a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that hes right on target) Where is this coming from? Shes great! (Concerned) Whyre you doing this Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up. Theres nothing wrong with my career! (Like a parent) Well I still like the Bloomingdales executive training program for him. I though we said we werent going to discuss that now! Well you know I think its something he should consider. Of course he should consider it but now is not the time! Listen George all these issues are interrelated. (Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) Im not buying any of this! All right so whatre you saying? That were wrong? Oh everybodys wrong but you! You know this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up and hes the same - but everyone else is different! Which one? They were all like that! Whyd you take away my scholarship Mister Costanza? Well Steven I uh.. (All the sudden a small gang steps out of nowhere surrounding George) These are my new friends - The Van Buren Boys. Oh.. nice. I want my scholarship back so I can be a city planner. What about architect Steven? Yeah well you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey Elaine try the beef - because thats realy au jus sauce huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce! (Sourly) Ill make a note of it. Yeah? Ohh kay! Well you know I had Bob Saccamano on the phone and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him) You cant tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman. What do ya mean? You signed the release. Yeah. He sat in mud. Not you. But I did sit in mud. (Stern) Ya didnt! You never sat in mud! (Pleading) I was all dirty! It ever happened! Understand? (To crowd) Hey hey hey! All right! Yeah uh yeah.. well.. Uh the pants. they uh they fit uh well - and so I uh decided I wasnt gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! What? Youre gonna go now? Hey woah! I dont.. (watches his friends leave) (Frantic) Kramer Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys. Hey now theyre tough cookies. Yeah and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now whatd you do? Uh.. ah (Looks over at Elaine and realizes he cant tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh nothing - nothing.. No I certainly dont have any stories if thats what youre implying. (Laughs heartily) (Frantic) Kramer do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?! Yeah well uh.. you know uh you didnt hear from me but uh the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind. You mean like a former member? These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean some of them arent even stories! (Holds one out) Look this is a list of things in his apartment! Is my toaster oven on there? How am I ever gonna turn this into a book? Well just shape them - change them. Youre a writer. Yes! Im a writer. Make them interesting. Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing! Well I gotta go to the airport. Im picking up my parents. What? Wherent they just here? Yeah. Im flying them in to meet Ellen. I dont know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her. Maybe we could all have dinner later? I dont think so. Im gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight. Oh hey! Hey have I told you about my bunions? Oh youre gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me but as Im stacking them up they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted) Kramer this is awful! We dont want to hear about this! Damn! What? Oh I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink! How much did you pay for them? Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves yelling out Newman!) Oh what didnt you like about the first chapter? Well it started out nicely: Im returning some pants. A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) I set of down a train tunnel... (turns page) But thats where the story takes a most unappealing turn. Oh no no! Thats where it gets interesting! Dont you see? The - the train is bearing down on you you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers! It just seems so cliched and obvious. Its not interesting writing. Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if instead of.. diving from the train you.. uh you I dont know you slip and and fall in some mud and.. ruin your pants? (Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. Thats perfect irony! Elaine that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps) I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4. (Picks up the phone) Peterman here. Mister Peterson you gotta sell me my stories back! You want to know something? I no longer need them! No no. Mister Peterman why dont we keep them - as a as a reference? Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales you vagabond! Yippie-yi-yay! (Hangs up) There you are Elaine. Go forth and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And by the way when you get to that chapter about my romantic escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix. Hey Van B. Boys. So Mister Costanza did you get my scholarship back? Now fellas fellas.. easy. You wouldnt want to beat up on one of your own. Right.. the sign. (Hesitates then makes a series of stupid gestures) Thats not the sign. (Defensively loud) It was when I was banging! Love to! (Cracks his knuckles then winces under the pain) And after college I got my masters at the Sorbonne. Sorbonne? Oh hey. (To Helen) Thats in Paris. (Looks at her watch) Oh Jerry youre parking meters about to expire. Dont get up Ive got change. (Leaves with her purse) (To his parents) So? What do you think? Jerry shes fantastic. I knew it! Im not crazy. Shes so sweet and shes got some body on her! And smart! Like a computer! And so much personality! But it doesnt matter what we think. Do you like her? (After seeing how much his parents like her) Now Im not so sure. Well shes 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with. yeah Amber.. I wonder if shes back from Vegas.. Alright alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds! Hey George! Shhh! Listen you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. Ill give it back to you later. Howre your folks? Eh theyre trying to pick out a new couch - you dont want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet or Ill spill your guts right here on the street! What did you say? Come on hurry up old man! Im an animal! Youre being very rude. Come on Morty. (Pleading) Please please theyre gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helens purse she starts hitting George defensively he backs off) Tell your parents we said Hi! (They leave)]

This is between you and her and her. (indicating empty chair) Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today she would agree with me too. Who. (uh-oh) Her? Where is she?! Ah--this is part of the problem! Iiii thought I was part of this problem. (smiling convincing) Youre a huuge part of the problem. But I think that at its core this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine! Well now that we have that cleared up.. why dont the three of us have lunch. (feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh Im coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!) She is The Best.

And it was Pretty Good. (proud to Peggy under his breath) Yeah but he didnt sleep with both of em. (winks) But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. (sighs) An nowww.. Susie is gone. (running in still hoarse desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didnt commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered by Jerry Sein-feld! (smugly under-his-breath) Not only that I broke his thumbs. Elaine? Guess what. Ive decided to Form a Charitable Foundation in Susies honor. And as Susies best friend I want you to be involved. Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward whispering) Im Susie.. Shes me.. (leans forward whispers carefully) I feel the same way. (announcing) And thats why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every Free Moment you have. (leaving pats her shoulders confidently) (looks up screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!]
146,8,16,[Morning. Morning. Hope you dont mind baking soda flavour. (applying paste to brush) Ah baking soda. Annoying little product. I can do this. I can do that. Why doesnt this stuff just shut up? Im gonna grab you a towel. Ooh-ooh So? So? She used the toothbrush! You said you grabbed it outta there real fast right? Yeah. So Im sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on you had already grabbed it out. How many years of med school did you have? Was she mad? You didnt tell her. Jennas like me. Shes very... (searches for word) Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious? Ill take fastidious. What is that? Ahh Steinbrenner gave em to us in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Holy cow! They dont actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say holy cow do they? Just the last few innings of a double-header. Hey. Look at this. Im in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits. Why didnt you pull over? Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didnt wanna lose him. The infrastructure Jerry its crumbling. Holy cow! Well look at that. A talking Nixon. China Panda. Yeah Id like to place an order. Ah yes what you like? This Supreme Flounder it says first time served in America. Is that true? What number? Forty-seven. Yeah first time. What else? Uh thats it. Address? Seventy-eight West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E. Thats southside. Sorry we dont deliver below Eighty-sixth. Im not below. Yes you are. Street itself is boundary. Your guy cant cross to my side? If we deliver to you then what? Eighty-fifth Street Wall Street Mexico Eighty-fourth Street. Alright fine. Ill just cross and meet him. Sorry food only for those who live within boundary. (slams down phone) (picks up phone) China Panda. (using silly voice) Uh yeah yeah. Id like to place an order. Ah what you like? Well Im a poppa. Bring it on. Nothings throwing me at this point. (handing Jerry a cigar) Well as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway. Oh that adopt-a-highway thing. Yeah Im part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here take a look. Mile one-fourteen. Aw looks just like you. Aw Im beaming Jerry. So what dyou have to do? Pay to keep it clean? They try to push you into using their cleaning crew with all their so-called maintenance equipment. That old scam. Yeah well thats why Im doing it all myself. This parenting isnt about delegating responsibility its about being there. At the side of the road with a pile of garbage. Quality time. Keys. I cant find my keys. You lost Phil Rizzutos head?! Have you seen em? No. Dammit! Cmon retrace your steps. What dyou do today? I got up I was supposed to go to work I came here instead. Right. Well theyre not here. Youll have to dig up your spare set. I dont have a spare set. All my keys say do not duplicate. So? So you cant duplicate em. Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid. Oh. Oh hi. China Panda? (suspicious) Why you waiting on the street and not in your apartment? I... thought that I would meet you halfway. You really live here? Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go keep the change. Bye now. Ill see you. (at the boys back) This isnt fair. This is address discrimination! Well I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf. So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth? By the time Im through with her mouth shell be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it? No stings the throat. Anyway so I was coming along here and I felt like a piece of cake you know? But then I thought its morning I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured well theyre really both cake. So I uh I sat on that bench for a little while twenty minutes or an hour and then I figured check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street! Now I remember as I jumped over the hole I heard a like a jingling sound. You didnt look down? I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here. No! No!! Holy Holy Cow! Poor son of a bitch. Its a hundred thousand revolutions a second. Its the most powerful one they make. Its like Im holding a blender. The engines made by McDonnell-Douglas. Oh no you keep going. It shuts off automatically. (restarting and reapplying the brush) Really it does? (unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out. (shouting to Jerry) I was really happy with my old toothbrush. No trust me that one was doing more harm than good. Dont forget to use the Plax too. That stuff tastes like bleach! I dont know anything about that. Mmm. My mouth feels so clean. Thats the idea. You know maybe we better not. I I think Im getting a little cold. I dont wanna give you any of my germs. Aww. Okay. Thanks I guess. You still couldnt kiss her? She has a taint. I cant see it but I know its there. Oh so now youre finding fault on a sub-atomic level. Maybe if I could shrink myself down like in Fantastic Voyage and get inside a microscopic submarine I could be sure. Although if there was something there it might be pretty scary. Course I would have that laser. Jer do you see where this is going? Being really clean and happy? Jerry you have tendencies. Theyre always annoying but they were just tendencies. But now if you cant kiss this girl Im afraid were talking disorder. Disorder? And from disorder youre a quirk or two away from full-on dementia. (thoughtful) Hmm that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey there it is. Shall we stop and say hi? Nah weve seen it. Yeah. (shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah Ill see you back at the house! Mile one-fourteen clean as a whistle. Yeah? Hi. Im your neighbour uh fr... from across the street. And uh (coughs nervously) I was wondering if it wouldnt be too much trouble if I could use your apartment to order some food? Wha? What dyou want? You see theres this certain flounder and they wont deliver it to my side of the street. Wh when is that? No I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all. Who are you with? No actually Im... Im just kind of hungry. Who let you in? Well the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it actually. But I just need like a half an hour to an hour. Whats with the signs? Hey you should see the Berkhardt Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks air-conditioners shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!) I just rolled em into the woods. Yeah that stuffs all natural anyway. (holding up a sign) Speed limit one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint God love em. Hey. So keys? No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course theres not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole. I guess they leave that up to the general population. I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there this wouldnt be happening! Hard to say. Hey you need some roadwork done? Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway they could probably help you out. Really? Oh yeah yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane. Yeah? Its Jenna. If you guys wouldnt mind I would like to ward off dementia. You think you could hook me up with these guys? Oh yeah yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. Im gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four. Seven-eight-four. Hey. Hi. How you feeling? Good. My colds gone and Ive been looking forwards to kissing you which Im ready to do now if you are ready. What?! Nothing. I just I uh I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasnt able to tell you before you could use it. What? Im sorry. When were you gonna tell me this?! Obviously never. I need the yield sign. Kramer Im kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here please? You couldve introduced me. I wouldnt know where to start. (knocking) Hey Jenna. Hey! There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet. What?! Wha... whatd you put in there? Gotta run. Oh man! (into phone) Hello Jenna did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit! She wont even give you a hint? No. Could be anything. The whole apartments a biohazard. You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote. Yes that is a definite possibility. (walking to the couch) Or could be your walkman there. Are you just screwing with me? Yeah I am. Hey ah. Hey hows life on the road? Oh Im making a difference Jerry. I dont doubt it. You should see the smiles on the drivers faces. I mean you gotta look quick but theyre there. Whats this? Well you know those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum bum bum bum bump) Isnt that some kind of safety thing? Well I had to pull em up if Im gonna widen the lanes. What the hell are you talking about? Ah you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room better ride? Well Im bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen. How are you gonna widen the lanes? Well you black out lane-lines one and three and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So you got any black paint? (sarcasm) Yeah in my toolshed next to the riding mower. (into phone) Yuh Id like an order of supreme flounder number forty-seven. Yeah apartment one-Q. One-Q? Whose apartment is that? Thats the janitor closet across the street. Youre pretending to live in a janitors closet just to get this flounder? Its better than eating it alone in the restaurant like some loser. That stuff is unbelievable. Id eat it out of a dumpster. (heading to door) How do you know about it? Youre not in the delivery zone. Well Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends. Well mines coming in ten so... see you boys. Now wheres that tool shed of yours? Hi. Sorry I didnt hear you. I was in the shower. Ill see you. You Costanza? Yeah. Thanks for thanks for coming by fellas. Eh got a set of keys buried in the pothole. Whatre the keys doing in there? Just need to uh to dig em up. You put em in there? Nah nah its uh its a long story. Just uh try to get it up. Bad place to put your keys. Yeah I know that. (clears throat) Could you start working? Difficult job. You want those keys were gonna have to dig this up. (penny drops) Oh uh wait a minute wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money? Yeah. (snorts) Its about money. Scuse me what are you doing in there? Uhm nothing. I was just uhm... I wasnt in there. You were hanging around in there lazing on the job. When you shoulda been downstairs in the basement cleaning out those old carpets and scrap wood. Right because... Im the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail) Dont get smart with me. (meek) Yes maam. Hey and if youre heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt whoah Nelly for some reason four lanes are converging into two instantaneously right at mile-marker one-fourteen. I dont know what that is but the A-Bs a parking lot out there. Somebody screwed up on that one. Oh its you. Is the flounder here yet? No its not here yet. You want the tour? (gesturing) Theres this. Nice. French doorsd really open this place up. Oh but you have a slop-bucket. (gleeful) The fish! Ah whatre you doing here? Hey. Hey. Oh I was uh I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer thought Id drop by. Kramers guys? Yeah. I got em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself. Oh thats nice kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp. Ow! Uh man! Huh yeah. (looks round) Oh sweet setup. Elaine dyou have any paint thinner? I need like uh forty gallons. Im plumb out. Oh man if I dont get that black paint off the Citys gonna go ape. I dont wanna lose my baby! Janitor? (to the guys) Uh Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah uh just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay Ive gotta get out. Here can you move you gotta move from the door. Hi I uhm... What can I do for you? I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement. Yeah I am so sorry. Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in their mouths. Well a lot of it is vegetable... Get that stuff outta there today or youll be outta here. Understand? (meekly) Yes maam. ...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia. I dont feel like eating. (holding up a set of heavy chains) Im gonna borrow this huh? (to Mrs Allister) Janitors meeting. So Jerry whyd you call me? Well I thought its about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didnt put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you? Yes I did. Well whatever. So howve you been? Good. Good. (pause) Steak knife? Just eating away at you isnt it? Nah. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Jerry can I borrow your car? For what? I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump. Dirt? Thats alright (for Jennas benefit) because theres nothing wrong with dirt. Well actually its pretty grimy. Grime grease filth funk ooze. Whatever it is you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery. Well I dont know who you are but thanks for the car. Sure. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. There you see? I just leant her my car and shes gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now for the love of God please what is it? What is it?! Toilet brush. Toilet brush oh (he pulls a Damn shoulda guessed! face). Alright I can replace that. You wanna order dinner? Yeah. Lets uh go to your place. Because I threw out all my dishes. Thats true. Mm. But Ill tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of what could be a meaningful long-lasting relationship. Do you hear something? I dont know what that could be. Holy cow! Anyway Im a new man and Im looking towards the future. Clean dirty whatever. Holy cow! Have a nice life. Hey look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo yeah. Bugger! (sings) Youre once. Twice. Three times a lady. What the hell was that? Double bugger! (sings) Yes youre once. Twice. Three times... Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh oh the humanity! Aaagh! Hey buddy. Whatre you doing out here? Man did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo hoo-hoo. Hey I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift? Newman! Newman!! Well Ill meet you at the coffee shop.]

Maybe he and I are exactly the same except for one minor yet crucial detail. You never know. (zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do. Maybe its some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat or a monocle or a..or a cane. (picking up his bag and coat) Whos she dating? Mr Peanut? (pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut my friend. So what dyou wanna see? (indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch? (indicating another poster) How about The English Patient? Its up for all those Oscars. Oh cmon Blaine. I mean look at the poster for Sack Lunch. Its a family in a brown paper bag. (laughing) Dont you wanna know how they got in there? No. (disappointment) Aww. Sold out. (to the booth guy) Oh two for The English Patient. So dyou think they got shrunk down or is it just a giant sack? (smiling) Uh hi. Uhm remember me? I..Im the guy who looks like Neil? (smiling back) Hi. Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm is Neil here? Oh no. He got held up at work. Oh thats too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him seeing as how we look so similar. Well you know you dont look that much like him.

(smiling) Listen I..I..I dont mean to seem forward... ...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neils phone number? (very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about The English Patient its so romantic. (vehement) God that movie stunk! I kinda liked it. (firm) No you didnt. Elaine. Elaine did you just see The English Patient? (tearful) Didnt you love it? How could you not love that movie? How about it sucked? That Ralph Fiennes I would give up my firstborn for him. (aside) Huhh getting the short end of that stick. Jerry this is Del Boca Vistas new physical fitness room. They got medicine balls you can bike ride anything you want. Stairmaster? What? Nothin.

You know I bought you a Cadillac. Twice. Hoh here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy Mandelbaum. Hes eighty years old but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch this. See that? You couldnt do that. I could but I choose not to. Hey Morty. (nodding toward Jerry) Whos this? This is my son Jerry from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he can lift more than Izzy. (protesting) I..I didnt say that. (calling over) Hey Izzy this kid says he can lift more than you can. Your kids pretty funny Morty. Should be a comedian. (smiles) Actually I am a comedian. Thats not so funny. (challenging) Think youre better than me huh? Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties. (jocular) Eighteen-fifties? Yeah thats it. Its go time. (points to the weights he put down) Lets see you lift that. (reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum I... Cmon cmon. Pump it! (consenting) Alright. Yeah wrong attitude. youre not bringing that trash into my house. There. Alright? Step aside stringbean. Ill show you. Were gonna take it up a notch. (agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh. (drawn out) Aaaahh. Somebody call an ambulance.

I thought you were busy tonight. (cold) Well to tell you the truth Elaine. I dont know if I can be with someone who doesnt like The English Patient. Its just a stupid movie. (to Carol) Thats what Im talking about. (taking Blaines arm) Come on Blaine. Lets go. (bitter) Enjoy Sack Lunch! (fierce) I will! (accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be ashamed of yourself. (defensive) He egged me on. You should be more mature. Hes eighty! (standing) Okay. Tomorrow Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise. Now goodnight. (walking after Morty) Youre not sleeping in that shirt. Its too tight. This shirt will never leave my body. (to Jerry) Goodnight. (smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty got the place to myself. Jerry Seinfeld please. Ah you must be Kramers guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars? What cigars? Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans. (indicating the threesome) We are the Cubans. Yeah hello Jerrys place. (animated) Theyre real Cubans?! Theyre human beings from Cuba?! I said Cubans. Whatd you think I meant? Cigars! Jerry Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. Thats why I got these guys. (incredulous) Youre making your own cigars now? Yeah yeah. I got investors all lined up. (to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad. (without looking up) Who are they? Theyre Cuban cigar rollers. (walking back out of the room) Dont tell your mother. What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce? Hot and spicy. (accusing) Youre not wearing a shirt are you? Yes I am. What colour is it? Damn! You know you couldve just given me Neils number. You..you didnt have to take me out to dinner. I wanted to give it to you in person. (flirtatious) You know I dont have to be up in the morning and I know a great breakfast place right around the corner. Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast? (inviting) Why dont you come in? Well take about it. (looking at his watch) I really should get going. Yknow I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls. Well goodnight. (hurried) Ill see you. Rough night? Ugh. You wouldnt believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends who I dont even like they wont talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I dont like that stupid English Patient movie. Really? I thought it was pretty good. Oh come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean please! Gimme something I can use! (sour) Well I liked it. (calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?

(doubtful) Theres crepe money? What are you doing here? (apologetic) Aw Mr Mandelbaum I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself. What the hell is that? What? That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad? This was a gift from my son. Oh I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta commission so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well Ill show you whos number one. Mr Mandelbaum please. Its go time. (pained) Ahh. My back. I cant move. Call an ambulance. I think I saw one a coupla doors down. (disbelief) So she wanted you to come up but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?! (animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle. (pointing out the obvious) George youve got Danielle. Forget about Neil. Youve out-Neiled him. (surprised) So Im Neil? How did I do that? I dont know but you better keep it up. Im gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) Theres a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha! (to himself) I try to take a vacation I come back the whole operations a shambles. (answers phone) Hello. Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back specialist? I will I just walked in the door. You have to go see him. Ma. Helen will you stop bothering him. Jerry that shirt is gone right to his head. Number One signing off. Jerry I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) Whats going on!? What? (animated) Theyre not real Cubans. Theyre Dominicans. So? So Jerry if my investors dont get Cubans the whole deals off. Whats the difference? Jerry once youve had real Cubans theres just nothing else like it. (confused) Were talking about people right? Yes yes. The quality the texture the intoxicating aroma. These guys dont have it. I thought they smelled pretty nice. Jerry your palates unrefined. Is not. Is too. Is not. Is too. Im not having this conversation. Are too. Am not. Are too. Am not. Are too. Another productive meeting. By the way I saw that English Patient film last night. It was extraordinary. (enthusiastic) Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me. Elaine whatd you think? (hesitant) Well uh act..actually I havent seen it. So I couldnt tell you whether I liked it or whether it really sucked. (aghast) You havent seen it? (shakes head) No. Thats it! Drop everything. Were going right now. Again Mr Mandelbaum this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if theres anything else I can do please dont hesitate to uh try and find my number. Uh oh wait. How bout that huh? The Worlds Greatest Dad. My son made it for me. (humouring him) Thats very nice. The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means Im better than just number one. Well I dont know how official any of these rankings really are. Hi son. (surprise) This is your son? I got married in high school. This is Seinfelds kid. (jocular) You got any kids? (trying to defuse the situation) Look no-one is lifting anything. (pointing) The television. (under his breath) Oh no. (urgent) Call an ambulance. (laconic) Were already in a hospital. Awright partner. Lets get down to business. (nervous) Okay well uh Ill uh Ill get the Cubans. Theyre right out here. Hey here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans. You wouldnt be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper now would you? (fidgety) Oh now come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban Castro wouldve smoked them himself. Huh. (confusion) Were talking about people right? (puzzled) I think so. I thought he quit smoking cigars. Well yeah yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis. (dubious) Dennis Castro? Uh Dwayne. Get the hell outta my office. (shrill) What!? You know Neil called me today. (interested) Really? Yeah. Hes pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with you. (smug) Ah I guess I showed Neil whos Neil. He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee. (little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me. (surprised) What? (smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee. (emotional) And I thought I knew what love was. (indifferent) Yuh. (incredulous) You asked her to move in with you? I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil. (musing) What if its Neil Armstrong? (animated) Then Im going to Mars! What if its Neil Diamond? (tormented) Aw shut up Jerry! Just shut up! Alright I gotta go back to the hospital. What to see the old guy? No I got into a thing with the son and now hes laid up too. How olds the son? I think hes the same age as the father. What is with this family? I dunno. Its like if one of em dies the other one wants to bench press the casket. (quietly) Hey Jerry. (noise - like shivery) Datiditadit. Youre cold? No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat. Something wrong with your chest? (indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There. (leaning round Kramer) Where? (urgent) No no. Dont look. Dont look. Over there. The Dominicans. Arent they supposed to be rolling cigars? Well it didnt quite work out and now Ive got nothing for them to do. So? So I taught em all about Cuba and they really took to it. You know Marxism the Workers Revolution the clothing. Boy they seem pretty angry about something. (nervous) Yeah. Im a little worried. When theres no work and the people get restless who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself shrill) El Presidente! I swear to you I didnt know they TV was bolted to the table. He couldnt handle the weight. (hostile) Oh so now you think youre better than me? (placatory) Look let me just state for the record I think youre both better than me. Okay. My dad. (incredulous) Oh come on! He was trying to lift the TV. (consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) Its go time. I still thought you could do it. Fellas fellas look I gotta go. Oh yeah thats right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And youve ruined our business with all your macho head games. (defensive) I didnt ruin your business. Yes you did. Theres nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the crepes. We gotta close it up. (uncertain) Dont you hire people to do that? Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. Thats what puts the magic in Magic Pan! (thinking) So you just need some guys that could roll em? Yeah. (having an idea) I think I can help you out. Ill see you later. Here. You think youre better than us dont you?! Huh!? Elaine I hope youre watching the clothes because I cant take my eyes off the passion. (quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I cant do this any more. I cant. Its too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert and just die already! (louder) Die!! (surprised) Elaine. You dont like the movie? (shouts) I hate it!! Shh! (shouts) Oh go to hell!! (quietly) Well why didnt you say so in the first place? Youre fired. (grabbing her bag and coat) Great. Ill wait for you outside. He was gonna fire you? The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert. Tunisia? Thats where they filmed the movie. Its supposed to inspire me. Well that doesnt sound so bad. I have to live in a cave. (sardonic) Oh. (smiles) These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. Its like theyre rolling a double corona. (to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik huh Guillermo? Im very happy with George. Im sorry Neil its over. Come on lets just eat our crepes. (pained scream) Aaghh!! My face! (concerned cry) Neil! Why are the crepes spraying? (looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm well thats why you gotta get real Cubans. Danielle.

There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space. Yeah well whatever. See ya Ah back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I cant believe I got the Low Fat!]
149,8,19,[So Marcy you shouldve seen me in the hot tub yoday. Why? I was naked. Oh George. I saw it. Howd he look? Okay. I wouldnt see it again. You know a friend of mine thought she got Legonares disease in the hot tub. Really? What happened? Oh yada yada yada just some bad egg salad. Ill be right back. (She gets up) I noticed shes big on the phrase yada yada. Is yada yada bad? No yada yada is good. Shes very succinct. She is succinct. Yeah its like youre dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monks) Hey. Hey George you know Tim Whatley. Yeah dentist of the stars. Whats up? Ill tell you whats up. Im a Jew. Excuse me? Im a Jew. I finished converting two days ago. Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard. Thanks. Hey where you just at the health club? Oh well I didnt do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know it was more like a Jewish workout. Ill see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks) Elaine the guys Jewish two days hes already making Jewish jokes. So what? When someone turns twenty-one they usually get drunk the first night. Booze is not a religion. Tell that to my father. Anyway guess what? Beth Lookner called me. Ooh. Beth Lookner still waitin out hat marriage. What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. Shes already remarried. I gotta get on that internet. Im late on everything. Anyway Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. Theyre trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt) Elaine all right who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey? Were double dating tonight and if we wear the same shirt well look like idiots. Hmm turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking. Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap. How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other) So Im on 3rd Avenue mindin my own business and yada yada yada I get a free massage and a facial. What a succinct story. Im surprised you drive a Cadillac. Oh its not mine. Its my mothers. Are you close with your parents? Well they gave birth to me and yada yada... Yada what? Yada yada yada... (To Mickey wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt. Oh thank you. Its 100 cotton and some wool. Well you too seem to have the same taste. Well I like it too. Well I have the same shirt. Yeah well Im wearin it. I like your shirt too. Oh so do I. Oh. (Waiter approaches table) Anything to drink? Some wine perhaps. I like Merlot. I love Merlot. Im crazy about Merlot. I live for Merlot. Were out of Merlot. So you uh know Betha and Arnie pretty well? Oh yeah yeah. Do you socialize with them often? Yeah we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies Arnies a real film buff. Oh. Actually I remember this one time um this is funny. Um we went to see the movie Striptease. I dont know if youve seen... doesnt matter. Anyway I was whispering something to Beth and Arnie leens over to me and he goes Would you SHUT UP?! I mean he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But theyre nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake) Oh youre in here. Whatre you doing here? I knew you had an appointment. Well this is very awkward. Ill leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you I am loving this yada yada thing. You know I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool) Hey you dont play with that. Thats going in my mouth. Hey what this thing? Whew! All right thats enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter) Hey Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises like a hissing or a chirping? George... Um... Fine Ill make an appointment. (He leaves) All right it is cavity time. Ah here we go. Which reminds me did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmers daughter? Huh? Hey. Those arent mahtzah balls. Tim do you think you should be making jokes like that? Why not? Im Jewish remember? I know but... Jerry its our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years. 5000. 5000 even better. Okay Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride. And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride. Why are you so concerned about this? Ill tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings) Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times? Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter) I dont believe that. If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we couldve figured this whole thing out. Why were you holding the door open for? Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man? Well I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong! Lets just put theyre names in a hat. I dont even know their names! Look why dont you just take the one that was on the left? Im not sure she was my type. Oh everybodys your type. What the hell does that mean? Youve been married three times. Thats it its go time! (Charges toward Kramer only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine) All right take it easy. Hey hey hey! Come on let him go. You want throw? Lets throw! Hey! Hold on a second. All right look I got an idea. Why dont you just show up early for your next date sit across from each other and see who the girls sit next to. Thats not bad. All right so we let the girls decide. Yeah why should we knock ourselves out? Yeah I wanna wear that shirt next time. No no one wears the shirt next time. Thats right cause they already saw it. Well look like idiots. (They exit) Well we were engaged to be married uh we bought the wedding invitations and uh yada yada yada Im still single. So whats she doing now? Yada. Speaking of exs my old boyfriend came over late last night and yada yada yada anyway. Im really tired today. Beth Arnie hi. Whats up? Well our adoption application was denied. Really. The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper. Oh. So were just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent. Uh you know I just told them what kind people you are and uh yada yada yada that is it. How you doing? I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim) Well the Curtis why dont you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis good guy. Oh which reminds me did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat huh? Ill tell you later. (Exits) Whatley. (Like Newman) What are they doing here? I told you we shouldve gotten here a half hour early. All right all right. Now whatre we gonna do? All right dont panic. Lets just decide now. Which one do you want? All right Ill take Julie. I knew you wanted her. Thats who I wanted. All right Ill take Karen. No no you think Im fallin for that? Ill take Karen. All right which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle) So Whatley sayd to me Hey I can make Catholic jokes I used to be Catholic. You see I dont think it is a Catholic joke. I think its more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys! Dont you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. Hes already got the two big religions covered if he ever gets Polish citizenship therell be no stopping him. So whatre you gonna do? I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch. (Calling on phone) Hey Beth Arnie its Elaine. Um thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye. Theyre not getting a baby so youre taking them out to lunch? Thought it would be nice. Poor Beth. Hey Arnies just as upset. Oh screw him! (George enters) Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night and yada yada yada Im really tired today. You dont think she yada yadad sex. (Raising hand) Ive yada yadad sex. Really? Yeah. I met this lawyer we went out to dinner I had the lobster bisk we went back to my place yada yada yada I never heard from him again. But you yada yadad over the best part. No I mentioned the bisk. Well I gotta do somethin. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters) Well I gotta do somethin. George is already in there. (Confused) No Mickey and I we cant work it out. You know Im thinking of asking that Karen out by myself. I thought you were leaning towards Julie. I was but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen. Well it was a helluva yada yada. Hes moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye I was just getting out of the shower and yada yada yada-- All right enough! Enough! From now on no more yada yadas. Just give me the full story. Okay. Tell me about the free facial. Okay well like I said I was on 3rd Avenue and I stopped by a large department store. Which one? Bloomingdales. Very good. Go on. Oh and I stole a Piaget watch. Whats that? And then I was on such a... high that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor and got a massage and facial and skipped out on the bill. Shoplifting. Well what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause) Excuse me Mother? Sister. Sister right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours? Well not until tomorrow. Hmm I really need to speak with him. Thats a kneeler. Oh. (Adjusts accordingly) Tell me your sins my son. Well I should tell you that Im Jewish. Thats no sin. Oh good. Anyway I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that hes converted to Judaism just for the jokes. And this offends you as a Jewish person. No it offends me as a comedian. And itll interest you that hes also telling Catholic jokes. Well. And theyre old jokes. I mean the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat. I havent heard that one. Oh Im sure you have. Theyre out on the ocean and yada yada yada and she says Those arent buoys. (Father starts laughing) Father... One second... Well if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed. You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist dont you? Um... Newer magazines. Now if youll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.) Jerry I gotta talk to you. Hi. Hi Kramer. Got a minute? Uh actually my parents are over but would you like to meet them? Sure. (Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom Dad. Hi. Elaine I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there? Well I dont know. I mean I talked to him and blah blah blah he asked about you guys and da da da da da more questions bleh bleh bleh.... All right shut up! Again you are telling me to shut up? What? You yelled that time at the movies. Thats why youre not getting the baby. Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth? Look Ill go down and talk to this adoption guy and Ill make sure that it all gets worked out. All right just dont screw it up this time! (He exits) See again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling. (In pain) Oh are you about done? Im just getting warmed up. Because Im just a sadist with newer magazines. Huh? Father Curtis told me about your little joke. What about all your Jewish jokes? Im Jewish youre not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through. The Jews? No the dentists. You know we have the highest suicide rate of any profession? Is that why its so hard to get an appointment? So Ill uh... all right. (Hangs up) Date with Karen? No Julie. Shes the one. What happened to Karen? Well Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people? Oh small world. So little people can have not little people children? Oh yeah and vice versa. Mother Natures a mad scientist Jerry. So you wont believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy. Those people listen to yourself. What? You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else in search of a dream. Kramer hes just a dentist. Yeah and youre an anti-dentite. I am not an anti-dentite! Youre a rabid anti-dentite! Oh it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. Hey denty! Next thing you know youre saying they should have their own schools. They do have their own schools! Yeah! One little baby whatever you have in stock. Miss Benes... Look it look it Ryan. These people are gettin a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way or we can do this the fun way. Jerry Im sorry to bother you but you always said youd be there for me. Well whats wrong? Im thinking of leaving Arnie. Talk to me. He met with Elaine and I asked him what happened and he yada yadad me. I mean could he be having an affair? Well I wouldnt put anything past anybody. But we just got married. Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is youre moving on. Why would Elaine do that to me? Forget about Elaine. Lets just focus on us. Come on big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter) Hey Jerry. Wheres Kramer? Ive got exciting news. Im kinda in the middle of something. Karen and I are getting married. Oh congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart. (To Beth) How many is that for you? Two. Youre a lightweight. Come on honey. Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth? Beth and Arnie broke up. So they dont want a baby? (Shaking his head no) Pff. (Realizes her mistake) I think Im gonna be sick. (George enters alone) Hey wheres Marcy? She uh went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and yada yada yada Ill see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter) Hey Kramer over here. I just assume not sit next to you. Kramer... Oh look theres Mickey and his parents. Nice looking family. Very handsome. (To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing? Hey Kramer. Oh Mickey. Excuse me I cant take this. (She exits quickly) Hi Mr. Abbott. Thats Dr. Abbott D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasnt my sons wedding day Id knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard. What was that all about? Oh I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion. Hey what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school? What? A dentist. (They laugh) Thats a good one. Dentists. Yeah who needs em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile) Wheres Beth? She went out to get her head shaved. We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony. Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out. Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss walk toward exit) (To Kramer) I really wanted you.]
150,8,20,[Uh excuse me. Be with you in a minute. (turns her back to Elaine and continues into phone) No you shoulda come last night it was fun. Uhm I just have a question. (into phone) I know the margaritas in that place are so strong. (walks up to counter) Helloo? Id like to buy these hirachis. (into phone) So? What else is goin on? (shouts) HEY!! Listen Ill call you back. (to Elaine) Yes? What can I do for you? (tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You just lost a customer. Ready to go? I dont wanna miss the previews. Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview I yelled out Must miss. I think that I was in that theatre. That that was really funny. Yeah it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go. So youre on the speed dial? After two dates! What number? Seven. Wha! You know its a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen. Uh hey buddy. Hey. It all right if I keep these here for a while? Im having a New Years Eve party. Youre gonna keep these here for eight months?!

I got a case of party poppers Im gonna keep in front of em. Hey so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch. What for? (smiling) Im on a winning ball club Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains. Really why dyou think theyre taking you out to lunch? (thoughtful) I have no idea. Alright I have had it with those Mayans. I dont mind the Mayans. (unfolding chair) You know that store Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis right and the saleswoman just completely ignored me. What we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis. No no not Putumayo. No no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah Marcellino he turned me on to it and hes one sixty-fourth Mayan. (slightly worried) You know Im starting to get a little nervous about this lunch. Whatd you have? Yeah Im gonna keep these here too huh? Theyll be alright. (begins to leave) Kramer these balloons arent gonna stay filled till New Years! (at the door) Well those arent for New Years. Those are my everyday balloons. George well be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting and we think that someone might be you. (surprise) Head of scouting? Interested? (playing it cool) Im still here. Now unfortunately league rules prevent us from making you an offer while youre still under contract. You understand what were talking about? So youre talking... No no. Were *not* talking. Were just talking. So you need me to get fired. We didnt say that. We couldnt say that because even if we did... ...we couldnt say that we said it. You see what were saying? (jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch? (serious) We didnt say that. Hi. Sorry Im late. Theres a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How bout I make it up to you with dinner? (pointedly) Someplace nice this time? Yeah Im sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. Id heard good things. (rising) I dont know got a two in Zagats. Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called. Hello? Hello? Whos this? Jane. What number did you dial? Seven? Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission bye-bye-o! (waves) (singing) Meet the Mets... ...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets. Good meeting? There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is I have to get fired from the Yankees first. You can do that. Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time you know uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying Wow! Now that guy got canned! So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence? Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine? You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real? So George... Yeah. (rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie now Im number nine on the speed-dial. So? So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots. What shes ranking you? Yeah this speed-dials like a relationship barometer. What is a barometer exactly? Its pronounced thermometer. You know in the year two-thousand well all be on speed-dial. Youll just have to think of a person theyll be talking to you. Itll be like wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples as if receiving a call on a mental phone) getting a call here. (to Jerry and George) Hey its Newman. (to mental phone) Hey how you doing Newman? (to mental phone) Oh you wanna talk to Jerry? (pleased) Oh flowers. You didnt have to do that. I mean the dinner and the play and the hansom cab ride. Well I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble. Oh. (resumes) ...you know make a good impression. Im gonna go put these in some water. I like the way you think. Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld you magnificent bastard! Sorry Im late but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case. Isnt that Babe Ruths uniform? Is it? (reaches into bag) Huh strawberries anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah thats good. Ooh juicy this time of year. Gotta get the good ones. Oh thats bad. Thats bad. So Jerry my millennium partys really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand? Some of us. (crumpling a piece of paper) I dont wanna exclude anybody. Hola. Shove it! What is all this? I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business theyd lost. I mean I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days. Ah no wonder were getting so much rain. Elaine Im having a millennium party so save the date. Hey you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already to his party. Newman? Yeah. (reads) Come celebrate the millennium with Newmanniun. Newman! Hi Valerie. Youre not Valerie. Im her step-mother. Drive. Its taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that speed-dial and I dont intend to lose my spot to you. But I never... (threatening) You just stay away from that phone. You wanted to see me sir? I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning... Oh yes. I already packed up my desk sir. I can be outta here in an hour. ...and I have to tell you its exactly what this organisation needed. We wanna look to the future we gotta tear down the past. Babe Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man with little-girl legs. And heres something I just found out recently. He wasnt really a sultan. Ah what dyou make of that? Hey check this out. (he stands to reveal hes wearing baseball pants) Lou Gehrigs pants. Not a bad fit. (a thought occurs) Hey you dont think that nerve disease of his was contagious do you? Uh I better take em off. Im too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his boxers) Big Stein cant be flopping and twitching. Hey how bout some lunch. Whatre you going for? You know uh Valerie I uh couldnt help but notice that Im on your speed-dial. You deserve it. But I cant help thinking that maybe theres someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone youve known you know more than a week. My stepmother got to you didnt she? What? No. Uuh I cant believe she did this again. Thats it! Shes off the speed-dial completely! Yikes! Well I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party. You just got it? Damn the mail is slow. (getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party but you just had to throw yours on the same day! I have done nothing unethical. Yeah well youre gonna have to cancel it because Ive told everybody about my party. Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again longshanks! I started planning this in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant that overlooks Times Square and I booked Christopher Cross. (worked up) Well what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs and quite a bit of ice. (thoughtful) What kind? Cubed. Thats good stuff and you can never have too much ice. Alright Ill tell you what Ill do. You can co-host the party with me under one condition. No Jerry. Jerry is not invited. I gotta invite Jerry. Hes my buddy. That he may be. But hes outta my life starting in the year two-thousand. For me the next millennium must be Jerry-free! How could they not fire you? Never thought Id fail at failing. Aw come on there now. (depressed) Feel like I cant do anything wrong. Nonsense. You do everything wrong. (hopeful) Everything? Everything. You really think so? Absolutely. I have no confidence in you. Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up dust myself off and throw myself right back down again! Thats the spirit. You suck! (pleased) I know. No no no no listen to me. I work in fashion. Together we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo. Do you need some help with something? (puzzled) You? Whatre you doing here? I own this store. No you dont. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously) Im Gladys Mayo. Ah this really sticks in my craw. Well Mrs Hamilton its certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie? Im sure shell be along. (handing over a glass) Have some wine Jerome. Okay. You know Jerome I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So attractive so strong so comedic. Uh good. Jerome I have a deliciously naughty idea. (nervous) What? Why dont I put you on my speed-dial? I dont know Mrs Hamilton. That doesnt sound... Dont be such a child Jerome. Hows number three sound? Valeries not coming over is she? Seven four... No... Two... Stop stop. This isnt right. What about Valerie? I wont tell if you dont. (leaving hurriedly) Wuhh... Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand... (yells) Newmanniun!! (whimper) Jerry? Alright Yankees two. Orioles nothing. Wait a minute! A short stocky bald man is streaking across the field. Oh my God George! Check that. Hes not streaking. Hes wearing a flesh-tone body-stocking. Apparently hes a bit bashful and oddly no-one seems upset. Kramer look its George. Everyone loves him. Yeah yeah I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen Jerry I cant let you come to my New Years party. (neutral) Fine. (agitated) I mean its killing me! Newmans got the jump on the invites and will crush me if I try to go it alone! (neutral) No problem. (swung by Jerrys argument) Youre right. I wont do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it huh. (pleading) Elaine you cant go to Newmans Newmanniun. (neutral) Okay. No no no. You gotta spend New Years nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry. (neutral) Fine. (frustrated shout) Oh come on!! (neutral) Alright. (triumph) Yesss! Alright so its you its me and its Jerry huh. (claps hands) Yeah now things are starting to snowball huh. Ill tell Newman I dont need him. So Ill uh see you two in the twenty-first century. (following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer Kramer wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun? Yeah. Okay I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business. Can do. Whatre you doing with a pricing-gun? That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents. (to himself) Still a rip-off. Hello? Jerry I was just at my stepmoms house and I saw that you were on her speed-dial. Uh well she uh probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you. Hold on a second. Hello? (seductive) Hi Jerome. Oh Mrs Hamilton this is a very bad time. Ive got Valerie on the other line. Just a second. Hello? Thats her on the other line isnt it? Well... Tell her I dont want you on her speed-dial. Hang on. She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton you gotta get me off this thing. I wont until she puts me back on hers. Hang on. She wants to be back on yours. Fine. But only if youre off hers. Hang on. Fine if Im off yours. No still me. Sorry. Hang on. Fine if Im off yours. I wont do it. Its my speed-dial and I dont trust her. Please Mrs Hamilton this is very awkward for me. (conspiratorial) Alright. Ill hide you in one of the emergency buttons. (hurried) Great bye. She said shell do it. Great. Hang on. Hello? Jerry. I cant get fired. Hey body-suit man. s up? (pointing) Hey body-suit man. Hi Im H.E. Pennypacker. Im a wealthy American industrialist uh looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh before I invest millions in a lucrative mine I Id like to go a little native. Uh Get the feel of their condiments of their unmentionables you know the real uh gritty-gritty. Well lemme show you what we have. Well uh I think I can just browse around on my own. (re the chips) Hmm Macchu Picchu. Are these free? Yeah. Hmm-mmm. Some of those are womens clothes. Oh not a problem. Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh. LOccupado. Come on what is taking you so long? Elaine I broke the price-gun so I had to move to plan B. Plan B? There is no plan B. (holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store. What?! Theyre dessicates. See they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes wont last five years without em. Thats not gonna do anything. Patience. Alright. Forget it! What? You have screwed me again Pennypacker! Ladies care for some chips? (emerging from the changing room) Well I dont mind if I do. Well Ive uh Ive changed my mind. I think Im going to build a rollercoaster instead. I heard what you did in the parking lot big boy and it is in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me my staff... I cannot believe that you body-suit man could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say it... Oh who am I kidding? I love it. Youre fi... Wait wait Mr Steinbrenner. George doesnt deserve any of the blame for what happened in the parking lot today sir. If theres anyone to blame here its me. Whatre you talking about Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the crazies again? No no. No no sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people today. Because Im tired of all your macho head games. (agitated) Hes lying sir! Im tired of all your macho head games! Macho head games? (puts arm round Georges shoulder) Hes just being loyal to me sir. Wilhelm youre fired. I owe you an apology body-suit man. Streak on. (rising) Now if you gentlemenll excuse me Im not going to the game today Im gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. (heads toward the door) Owners box thats gotta bring in forty bucks no problem. Mr Wilhelm what was that?! I wanted to get fired. George you are looking at the new head scout of the New York Mets. (singing) Meet the Mets meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the Mets. I dont know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean without dessicates those clothesll be noticeably musty in five years. She never sees the big picture. Hello Newman! Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her cancellation in the mail. Oh well I guess she found some place better to go. Well its her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a lifetime. Well maybe so but come midnight when shes looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss I guess youll be caught between the moon and New York City. Alright. Come back to my party please. Jerry too of course. (reluctant) You dont wanna do your... act or anything do you? No. Alright then I guess I can accept a little Jerry if it gets me a (suggestive) lot of Elaine. Deal? To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand) (grasps Newmans hand) To the Kramennium. By the way Newman Im just curious. When you booked the hotel did you book it for the millennium New Year? (smug) As a matter of fact I did. Oh thats interesting because as everyone knows since there was no year zero the millennium doesnt begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party one year late and thus quite lame. Aww! I dont feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside. Ill call for help. Hello? Whos this? Its Jerry. Whos this? Uh its Valerie. Oh hi Valerie. Whats up? Ill tell you whats up. My stepmother is violently ill so I hit the button for poison control and I get you! Wow poison control? Thats even higher than number one! Hello?]

Well I dont know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay? So get this: were in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog. So? So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another. Oh really. You tell her you shaved it? Are you nuts? I dont want her to think Im one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest. (yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry. (yelling) Im starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha. Reality tour? The last thing this guys qualified to give a tour of is reality. This was my idea you stole my idea. Elaine these ideas are all in the air. Theyre in the air. Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea. You want a muffin or not? Peach. So I notice you dont have much of an accent. Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation. Look george Im really enjoying spending time with you but Im not sure this is going to work out. At some point youre going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie. Willie. Yeah. And Im still going to be here. Well what if I told you Im thinking of moving here? (laughs) George no offense. But this city would eat you alive. Youre moving to New York? Thats fantastic. I can see you all the time now. Eat me alive huh? Well see who can make it in *this* town. What is it she think you cant do? Find a job. Get an apartment. How did you do those things? Never mind. There done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything Ive ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day it looks decent. Hey what were you doing with that bus yesterday? Here you go here you go check it out. The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Im confused. Petermans book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories. Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown persons life. Im only charging $37.50 plus you get a pizza bagel and desert. Whats desert? Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats. He eats those? No. I eat those. Im the real Peterman. I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now you Kramer are real. Talk to me. But your life is Petermans. Now the bus tour which is real takes to places that while they are real they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you. Understand? Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers. Elaine. Im in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops. So? What do you want me to do about it? Youre the muffin top expert tell me what Im doing wrong. Mr. Lippman when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing I believed in you you know as a man of integrity. But I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin... What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits? Deal. Heres your problem. Youre making just the muffin tops. Youve gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top toss the stump. Taste. Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah? Yeah. So what do we with the bottoms? I dont know give em to a soup kitchen. Thats a good idea. And one more thing you really think we need the exclamation point? Because its not Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!* No. No. It is. Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? Whats going on? What? Cant I get a moments peace? What are you doing to yourself? I cant stop. Alex thinks Im naturally hairless. You cant keep this up. Dont you know whats going to happen? Everytime you shave it its going to come in thicker and fuller and darker. Oh thats an old wives tale. Is it? Look at this. (high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And its all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard. Oh come on. Thats genetics. Thats not going to happen to me. Wont it? Or is it already starting to happen? Wow. Look at this. Were cleaning up. Oh Rubin get me another tray of lowfat cranberry. Excuse me Im Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter. Oh hi. Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter? You been enjoying them? Theyre just stumps. Well theyre perfectly edible. Oh so you just assume that the homeless will eat them theyll eat anything? No no we just thought... I know what you thought. They dont have homes they dont have jobs what do they need the top of a muffin for? Theyre lucky to get the stumps. If the homeless dont like them the homeless dont have to eat them. The homeless dont like them. Fine. Weve never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this? We were just trying to help. Why dont you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells. I think I might. I cant believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay? $2300. Ouch. A month? Yeah. Well guess thats all right for now but if you say here for more than a few months youre a real sucker. Yeah well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed. Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something. Comming up on the right if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. Its the one thats covered in chicken wire. Hey if youre the real Peterman who come youre wearing those ratty clothes? There not very romantic. (over the speaker) Well thats your opinion. Forget it. Okay Newmans postal route is around here somewhere. Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing and I cant drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomezs place of worship is right on the right here. Why do I have to go on the tour? Jerry youre a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and Ill only charge to 60 bucks. Hey hows business? Ooh Ive got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department wont get rid of them all I cant get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile Im sitting on a mountain of stumps. All right Ive got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus. Bus? Wait a minute wait a minute bus? Youve got a bus? Yeah. You got any room on that thing? Yeah there are a few seats still available. Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? Ill make it worth your while. Well if they dont mind sitting in the back. No they dont. Are they war veterans? Wow this is your office. Woah. Hello. Sorry George didnt know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George help me out. Mr. Steinbrenner I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here. Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken? Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave) Wait a minute George. Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner. Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the os) Bloooooooooooooooooooown. You know when you make a pizza bagel you really shouldnt use cinnimon rasin. You also shouldnt use a donut. All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour... Turn music off. Can we just go? And go we will. What is this? A piece of pound cake? We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository. And were off. You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him but this is pretty close. (the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand hes been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that. (the back of his head also to the camera) Well I dont know who he is but if you want him that bad Im not giving him up that easily. Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy? How about this. You give me Castanza I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels chicken twists. Instead of beer alcoholic chicken. How do you make that alcoholic chicken? Let if ferment just like everything else. That stuff sounds great. All right. Ill have Costanza on the next bus. Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think youre going? I was going to dump this. It doesnt look like garbage. Well its muffin stumps Where are the muffin tops? This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it. Cant do it. Is this a joke? Thats what Id like to know about it. You have a pretty heavy beard dont you? Whats that? Well look its almost time for you to shave again. Oh. Yeah. (gets back on the bus yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen youre in for an additional treat. Were going to extend the tour at no extra charge. Where are we going? (looking at a map) I dont know. (over the speaker) Uh no more questions. So the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken. Dogs twists a kind of fermented chicken drink. Hey arent you the guy I asked to watch my clothes? What clothes? These clothes. The ones youre wearing. (in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and its itching me like crazy. I cant let her see me scratch it. Dont worry. Ive got a good feeling about this dump. Im telling you man Im losing it. I cant sit on this bus anymore. I think Ill go play with that dog. I dont know where the tops are. Jerry whats the matter? (for the first half of the howl a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo that feels good. Hey you looking for George? Yeah. Hes been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him. (talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. Im standing in the mens room on 43rd street in my underpants. I told you this city would eat you alive. What is this guy again? They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away. Hello Elaine. Where are they? In the back. All right Im going to need a clean 8 ounce glass. What is going on here? If Im curt then I appologize. But as I understand it we have a situation here and time is of the essence.]
152,8,22,[Nah you had a good run. Took them to the World Series. I got to give the players most of the credit for that. Dont sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements hotels busses. No I dont know who was doing that. So when you actually did work what it was that you did? They had a pastry cart you wouldnt believe. Here you go. Your latt&eacute; your cappuccino. Maybe I should ask her out? She is a good waitress. Thats true. Maybe I take her to the Tonys. Youre going to the Tonys? Yeah I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets. Why didnt you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. Whats the deal with those guys down in the pit? Theyre musicians. Thats not a joke. Its a funny observation. Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing. They did it for three years. Whats another few months. Im really going to do something with these three months. Like what? Im gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order. Ive always wanted to do that... Im gonna play frolf. You mean golf? Frolf frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer of George! ...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him. Whos that? Thats Sam the new girl in the counting. Whats with her arms? They just hang like salamis. She walks like orangutan. Better call the zoo. Reer... What? ssssss... Cat-ty... Its like shes carrying invisible suitcases. Like this? (imitates the walk) Yes exactly. Thats so strange. Right. So why Im the one who gets reer. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. Its a double standard. Oh what about ladies night? Women admitted free before 10? That is so stupid. Reer. Hey The White Shadow is on... Boy your really packing it all in. Jerry my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides I did plenty today. Like what? I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it. Hey Jerry you got any Tums? Stomach ache? I drank too much water in the shower. Aah top of the fridge. Hey George Im taking that waitress to the Tonys. Shadow! Oh the Tonys. Ill see you there buddy. Youre going to the Tonys too? Roger that. Where are you sitting? Well all over the place. Yeah Im a seat filler. They dont like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back. How did you get that job? Mickey Mickey he hooked me up. Hes a member of the academy. What academy? Well he didnt say (leaves). Hi! Hi! Nice tuxedo. Thanks its a breakaway. Should we go? Absolutely. Lyle were going! Jerry this is Lyle. Hey how you doing? Ok... Bye. Have a good time. Thanks Lyle... Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered. Ill just squeeze in... What are you doing? My job. What are you doing?

(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me. ...and the best musical award goes to: Scarsdale surprise! Kramer? (on TV) Thank you and God bless you all. This has truly been a Scarsdale surprise! Elaine am I crazy? I just get the feeling that Dugan and the others are making fun of me all the time. Well You might wanna think about...maybe eh...moving your arms a little when you walk. My arms? You know sort of swing them so your not lurching around like a caveman. I a caveman? No no no no its just... Everybody told what a catty shrude you are. Your horrible! She had a dude? Yeah when I went to pick her up there was this dude. How do you know it was her dude? What do you think it couldve been just some dude? Sure dudes in this town are dime a dozen. I reckon. Or maybe she just wanted to go to the Tonys. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude. Dude! All right thats enough. I gotta go home and take a nap. Its 10:30 in the morning? I tell you; Im wiped. So has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing? De-compressing. Whooa good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you. You didnt give that thing back? Jerry it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage the media is sworming champagne is flowing...whooo! I cant describe how great it is to win. Thats because you didnt win. Scarsdale surprise. Thats the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder. Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch! You havent even seen it. Aah Jerry Im not gonna let you bring me down from this high. Ive been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Lizas! What Minellis!?! No. Sam listen Im so sorry about the other day. No dont apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more. See yeah thats all I was saying. Hows this (Sam hits a pen case out of the table) or this (swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right). Well you seem to be getting a hang of it... Hi! Sorry Im running late. I just lost track of time. No rush. Hey Jerry! Whats up? (to himself) I have absolutely no idea. ..except that the dude plays the showroom and Im stuck doing food and beveridged! Whos that? Its Kramer. Hey Kramer. George says hi. (shouts to the telephone) Hi George! Hows that Tony? Why dont you just come over? Why cant we do this on the phone? Whats Kramer doing now? Hes looking on to fridgerator. Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles? I cant do this. So whats George doing? Hes not doing anything. Goodbye! So listen Im going to crab a bite to eat at Sardis. You wanna go? Are you taking the Tony to Sardis? The Tony is taking me to Sardis. Oh hello. Im going. Congratulations! Oh thank you thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and dont want to forget anyone... All right all right. I said no! (hangs up the phone.) Jerry I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely over. Id rather be with you. Just me? No dudes or fellas? What you think? I can start right away. But not here. (They leave.) Im not here leave a message. (on the answering machine) Jerry whats happening? Come on pick up the phone. ...so I said to him: Arthur Artie come on why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. Thats what people want to see. Mr. Kramer my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. Im one of the producers of Scarsdale surprise. Hey eh Lew! We need to talk. Elaine what did you want to talk me about? This. My office. Sam trashed my office. Well I see whats going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight. Mr. Petermen this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms. Woof! Do you mean reer? Yes thats the one! Good day Elaine. (Leaves.) Oh no please Mr. Peterman shes crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings... I cant believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this wouldve be their whole life. Now what time are you picking me up tonight? Eh what? You got our reservation from Sfuzis didnt you? Oh yeah Sfuzi? I- Ive gotta do that. Should I ware the outfit I bought today? Sure. Which one? The one with the...(mumbles.) If I wanna get my hair cut Ive gotta go now. Call me when you get home. I wont be there but leave a message so I know you called. Ok ok... Do you mind? No Ill crab it. Hey Ive done that today. What did you lose your remote? Nah the cables out. Whats with you? You look dead. Its Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something. (Laughs) Relationship intern...hey what if two of us teamed up? Not. No no... No because thats... No listen; we are always sitting here I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up? Here. Exactly! Because neither one of us cant handle a woman all by ourselves. Im trying. Ive tried. We dont have it. But maybe the two of us working together at full capacity could do the job of one normal man. Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right! Im sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didnt have anything to do with the actual production. No. I dont think theres no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless... Anything... Are you familiar with our star Raquel Welch? Oh yeah shes fantastic.... Shes a train wreck. Theres a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover. It is a gut wrenching scene. But Raquel Welch doesnt move her arms when she tap dances. Its very distracting. Theres lot of this (swings his arms) in tap dancing. So youd like me to teach how to dance? No we want you to fire her. Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch? Because theyre terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true. She seems very nice. Jerry youre not in show business. You dont know what these people are like. Im in show business. Oh come on! What am I gonna do? Shes going to eat me alive. Ive got a tape of Fantastic voyage if you think that would help. Yayaya... Jerry that crazy straight-armed woman down at Petermans trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me. Elaine...I am going to find you. If not in your office then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the kitchen... She mustve got a blueprint of the building or something. Did you tell Peterman about this? Well I tried but he thought it was some sort of cat fight. Cat fight? Ok why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight? Yeye cat fight! Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other theres a chance they might somehow kiss. T-t-t-t... You got the tickets? Yeah two for the 7:15 of Novaj pravas (?). What youre wearing the green sweater? I like it. She doesnt like. Here is your blue one its her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.) What? Just put it on! All right now remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me all right. Here you go hey hey hey hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerrys mouth.) Go getem youre a tiger! Hey George one second shes having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations. A little notice wouldve helped! How many people? 35 and George on the invitations... I know I know...dont skimp. Go go go go... Right on time I like that. I like your nails that is a great color. Love the sweater. This old thing? Hi I need some party invitations. Okay have you been in here before? About a year ago. Wedding invitations. Right how did that all work out? No complaints. Well they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.) Actually (George flips the book back to the beginning) Ill take these nice glossy ones. You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You havent even been to Scarsdale. Ms. Welch. Who are you? Well Im Cosmo Kramer Im one of the producers. Hello Sidney! No no I told you I dont want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! (hangs up) Kids! Youre still here. Well I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding eh your performance. What kind of problem? Well it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television carnivals water parks... Out with it! Well youre fired because you dont move your arms when you tap dance youre like a gorilla out there Ive gotta go... Little help? Hey frolf? Yeah you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in? Yeah sure. Ok come on. Ok lets towel it up. Jerry where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they dont go out today theyre useless. But were in towels. Jerry. all right. One second. He frolfs he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.) Hello. George where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman! Did you shave your chest hair? No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up? Yeah the super glossy. The best they had. Ok get them over here pronto. Were in towels here George. All right All right keep your towel on. Its a joke. All right thats not bad. Now get over here! (on the tape)...if not in your apartment then in the laundry room or the ATM in the building across the street or the watch shop! Cant you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho! Look just because Im a woman... I dont move my arms when I dance. Thats my signature! Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. Shes about ye high and eh she doesnt swing her arms when she walks. Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.) What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing? Arent you Raquel Welch? You know who I am. Now what are you doing? Nothing I wasnt just moving my arms... Thats it you are going down. So hows George? I dont know. They dont tell me anything. Whats that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony) Tony. What happened to you? Raquel Welch! Yikes. What happened to you? Raquel Welch! The woman is a menace. Yeah I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly. Cat fight with Raquel Welch. Yey eye ca-catfight. My god George! I slipped on the invitations...hows the towels? Back on the rack. With the two of us? I think were still a man short. Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy due to a period of extreme inactivity. But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck I think theres a good chance you may one day walk again. Well thats good news. Wow invitations again... Yeah thats weird. All right well...you want to grab some coffee? Yeah... Id like to get some coffee. This was supposed to be The summer of George! The summer of George. Now swing them...swing...swing them just swing them. I cant do it. Its hard! Still a little summer left.]
153,9,1,[What is Holland? (also wearing a moustache) What do you mean what is it? Its a country right next to Belgium. No thats the Netherlands. Holland *is* the Netherlands. Then who are the Dutch? (picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore. I know I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star. I told you we should have taken some kind of vacation. Well why didnt we? Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. Thats what you said. What if we grew muttonchops? No. Buzz cuts? Parachute pants! Stop it George. Stop it. Im sorry youve gotta get a job. (resigned) Dammit. Hey hey hey check me out huh? No more crutches that must be a relief. Yeah with crutches everyone has questions. Not with a cane? Nah with crutches its a funny story with a cane its a sad story. You through with those? That is a sad story. Hey you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot. Alright were back in! We? No. (off camera) Ladies and gentlemen Kenny Bania. Thank you thank you (To Jerry) Hey Jerry did ya see me up there? I was killing Jerry. Killing. I killed. Killed? Killed. (pause) Im gonna go pick up some chicks. Good-looking ones too!

He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. Hes a time slot hit. Jerry you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerrys butter across his face) Youre just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) Ill see you later buddy. Wait wait wait wait wait a minute. What? Do I have to ask? I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else Mr. Nosy? Why are you buttering your face? Im shaving with it. Oh Moses smell the roses. Jerry its vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face. No. Feel it. I dont want to. Feel it. Feel it. (places two slices of bread against Kramers face) That is close. I got the job? George everybody here at Play Now is very impressed with you. I Im sure you heard that. Well no. Now I dont want you to think that anyones gonna treat you any differently just because of your uh (clears his throat) handicap. Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh Im not handicapped. Im sorry. Differently uh advantaged. Yeah I didnt mean that. Of course you will have your own private fully equipped bathroom. (shocked) When do I start? Whenever you feel that youre able. (rises to show George out) Um you need a hand here. (Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah what the hell. You got the job? Jerry its fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think Im handicapped they gave me this incredible office a great view. Hold on they think youre handicapped? Yeah yeah well because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me! How can you do this? Jerry lets face it Ive always been handicapped. Im just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did made more money had a wife a family drove a better car than I did. He drove a car with no arms? All right I made up the part about the car but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway! Do you know how hard its getting just to tell people I know you? I love that bathroom. Its got that high high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building. Hey! They hooked me up. Whats with all the butter? Im shaving with it and you know what I discovered? You can eat it? No my face feels so good Im gonna use it all over my body. Oh my god its Bania and Jenna. Who? The tooth brush in the toilet bowl. Hey Jerry this is Jenna. Pretty good-lookin huh? Uh Jerrys the guy that I dated right before you. Oh. This is awkward. Dont worry Kenny. After dating Jerry youre a pleasure. I dont believe this. You miss her dont you? No! Hes riding my coattails again. Hes getting everything off me first laughs now ladies. You miss her. (to flight attendant) You know I think ultimately Im upset with myself. I knew what I was getting into shes a bitter unstable person. I mean the sex was good. Im sure it was fine for her. I need more. (to another passenger) Huh. You believing this? Excuse me I...I was sleeping. You missed quite a performance. (disbelieving) Thats my apple juice. Someones cooking. Hello Jerry. Hello Newman.

You useless pustule. Um somebodys got something on the griddle. maybe its Kramer. No hes up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no! Butter? (explaining the coins to Elaine) This is the fimty kroner. (to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head. David you are so funny. Yeah I know. (grabbing Puddy) What are you doing? Its a long flight Elaine. I had to get on with my life. By making time with some floozy across the aisle? Yeah thats right. Well whats going on over there with you and uh Vegetable Lasagna? This guy? Hes an idiot. he doesnt mean anything to me. (hereon known as Vegetable Lasagna) I can hear you. Well she doesnt mean anything to me either. If it were up to me wed still be together. Well maybe I feel the same way. Ok. Ok so now what? Lets make out. Kramer! Oh man. I think I cooked myself. Look at your skin. Stick a fork in me Jerry. Im done. Im fried. Technically youre saut&eacute;ed. So what are you doing for that? Well I just gotta keep my skin moist so I dont dry out. Is that what the doctor said? No I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) Ill see you later. Yea. Hey. Hey. How you doing? (Kramer leaves) (sniffing) Hmm. Game hen? Kind of. Nice limp youre bringing your work home with you? No I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle. What happened? Well I was buttering myself up for a nice shave -- Oh no not you too? I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and... You know whats good for that? Relish. Hello? Yeah this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I dont believe this. Theyve added Bania to the network showcase and hes going on right after me. So what hes got a couple of good jokes. Oh like what Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel? Thats true that always happens to me. You think thats funny? I dont know I like stuff you dont have to think about too much. You like Banias act. Youre a closet Bania fan! Maybe I am. Oh Im gonna puke. Puke! Thats a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke!

The bump into always leads to the backslide. David and I will not be getting back together. Elaine breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine.

You see I come up with these things I know theyre gold but nothing happens. You know why? No resources no skill no talent no ability no brains. (interrupts) No no...time!

Well you remember my corporation Kramerica Industries. Alright. Well apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience. But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience. Well this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things like my bladder system. Alright its time to go. Jerry its not for people its for oil tankers. (sarcastically) I know! You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes the oil wont spill out. Actually that is not a bad idea. (smiles) yeah. Now its time to go. Hello (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office). (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So whats going on?

(looking shocked) Really? When? In 10 minutes. Do you need directions? No I dont. Well Ill call back in 5 minutes to confirm. Yeah 5. Hey! Hey! So wheres my money? No money I am Puddy free. So are we eating or what? Oh yeah hold on. Hello Darren this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left? Hey Elaine is going to come with us alright? What? When did this happen? Well just... (yelling) DARREN! I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories David Puddy. (Picks up phone). Well Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out. Do you have to write all this stuff down. Well Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didnt want to miss anything. So how hot did it get? I dont know 120 130...Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos. I guess you can take anything but actual work. Bring it on! (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer! (doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e! (doing the voice) La la la. Sorry I couldnt get out of there what did I miss? (asking his intern) Well after ordering Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit... Uh huh... (Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there! Oh that makes a lot of sense. Oh shut up! ...Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfelds drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me This never happened. (Jerry then spits out the water). (giggling) Whats so funny? Oh nothing. (still giggling) What are you laughing about? Tell me. Oh all right this is really dumb really stupid. Weve been doing this silly dumb voice. So is it fun humiliating me? No its not you. Its your stomach hes taking with this funny booming jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. So you think Im fat? No its... Mr. Kramer says hey buddy! Hey were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later? Oh yeah sure sure. Should we set something up now? (Screams) GET OUT! Im leaving too. No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character like the Kool-ade guy. He is fat! No hes just a little bloated. Good-bye! Its mostly water weight. Boysenberry the kid is still learning. Mr. Kramer...Dean my internship is on line two she wants to set up a meeting. Yeah well nothing before noon. Line two? Yeah your phone is line one. Oh... So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny. See this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day but it doesnt mean we are back together. I mean I love just seeing you and having sex. Yeah. Not having to do all that...you know...work. Well either way... All that calling you and buying you stuff... David... Caring about how everyone at work isnt as smart as you. Its brutal. Alright thats it! Were back together! Oh no. Oh yeah. Look Elaine be reasonable. Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle. What? You heard me. Strip! (whistling)....(laughing)....Alright......OK.... (on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? ...Yes. If he needs me tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks. Dean Jones you wanting to talk to me? Ive been reviewing Darrens internship journal. Doing laundry... ...Yeah. ...Mending chicken wire hi-tea with a Mr. Newman. I know it sounds pretty glamorous but its business as usual at Kramerica. As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken. And with Darrens help well get that chicken. Im sorry but we cant allow Darren to continue working with you. Well I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary. You fly is open. So youre sure youre not still angry about last night? No Im fine. Just as long as you dont ever do that voice again. Never? Never. What about if youre not around? No! So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice? Thats right. I can do that. So whats your decision? I dont know. Jerry...HI. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha) You broke up with her? Why? So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter? I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la? No it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o. I think I like the girl better than the voice. Really? (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. Still? I told you. Alright here you go choke on it (hands him money). See never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together. Yeah well not for long. Im breaking up with him. No I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet. Double or nothing. Done. (talking from bathroom) Witness? Youre in there again. I think Play Now is putting something in my food. Alright Im out of here. What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him). I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right? Yeah. Nine oclock. I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago. (doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer. Jerry buddy I got to tell you something. That voice is played. Really? So played. I told you. Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship. I dont care about the internship. I care about Kramerica. Kramerica is no more. What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills. Probably. Darren you go home. Forget about Kramerica. Well youre still here? I havent had time to leave. Well I havent changed my mind. Well you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work! Lets see what Jerry has to eat. You win George. Weve had it. If you leave right now Play Now will give you six months pay. Thats half of your entire contract. Please...just go. You see if I stay the whole year I get it all. Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees George Costanzas handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families. Well played. Ill see you in hell Costanza. (on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright were back together again great. Bye bye. Hey. Trouble down at the plant? Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system. You have to drink that whole thing? No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact. I understand (not really understanding lol). Would a giant rubber ball work? Conceivably. Well Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office? Youre not... Oh yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil. Hey you want to split a root beer (I think thats what he says)? I dont think so David were through. Oh...Thats a nice sweater (Elaine smiles). Whew that was a dozy. Go again? Book it. (again from bathroom) Witness. David I know this hurts but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some). Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Im going to get some popcorn. So how did it end? They got away. uh. Listen David Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks? Hey. Did you bring the video camera? Yeah I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment the arrest and most of your trial. Alright Ill see ya. Oh you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped. I cant. I got to meet Clare. You gave up the voice? Yeah I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again. No. No Darren? Sorry Mr. Seinfeld. Uh bathroom. Hey use mine. Ill let you in. I thought it was open to the public. I uh took care of that. Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I? I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it. Whew. You know Darren if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems I wouldve said youre crazy... Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window. So check out my view. Wow! Hey theres Clare. I better go down. Hey theres Kramer & Darren. Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! I dont believe this. I am not looking up if youre going to do that voice. Bombs away (Uh oh). This is going to be a shame. Hello. Well that didnt work. Hey how about this...ketchup and mustard in the same bottle? Oh that sounds interesting sir. Yeah. Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore. Yeah. So theyre not paying you your... No. So youre pretty much... Yeah. What ever happened to Darren? Darren is going away for a long long time. So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that... (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil... (doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel... (doing the voice) La la la. Im just so glad its back. See this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together. ELAINE: I want to break up. Ah nuts!]
155,9,3,[I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward. Thats as far as it goes. Theres a mechanism. You just pull it and throw your body weight. I pulled it. It doesnt go. If you want the leg room say you want the leg room! Dont blame the mechanism! All right Dad were five blocks from the house. Sit sideways. Like an animal. Because of her I have to sit here like an animal! Serenity now! Serenity now! What is that? Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too high the man on the tape tells me to say Serenity now! Are you supposed to yell it? The man on the tape wasnt specific. What happened to the screen door? It blew off again? I told you to fix that thing. Serenity nowww! So I told Bobby and Lisa that wed try the new Chinese Spanish Oh I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener. Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away. What? All right fine. Are you mad at me? No I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is. You know... Ive never seen you mad. I get peeved. Mad. Miffed. *Mad*. Irked? Id like to see you get *really* mad. Why does she want you to be mad? She says I suppress my emotions. So what do you care what she thinks. Good body. She probably gets that impression because youre cool. Youre under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that. But I get upset Ive yelled. Youve heard me yell. Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters) Hey. Kramer I am so sick of you comin in here and eatin all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here! (Laughing) What is that a new bit? I told ya. Hey any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my fathers screen door in Queens? Sorry Im fixing a screen door in the Bronx. Ill do it. Really? You wanna come? Yeah I love going to the country. Where are they goin? Fix a screen door in Queens. (Laughing) Thats funny. Hey listen what are you doin Saturday night? Not goin to the Knick game. I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippmans sons Bar Mitzvah. You know if you dont bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift. (Taking out Boggle) Oh I dont think thats possible. (Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I cant see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect. Dad the hinges are all rusted here. Thats why the wind keeps blowing the door off. I hate that old door. Throw it out! Serenity now! It might be time to just let her go Frank. Shes worked hard for ya. Will you put her to rest for me? Oh yeah Ill take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door) (From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the garage. Dad whats all this? (From other room) Its junk. My computers. Ive been selling them for two months now. Shut up! Youre selling computers? Two months ago I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was called The Net with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading and I realize it wasnt that farfetched. Dad you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM? Yes I do. Thats why I got a secret weapon... my son. Damn it they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk! I think they have 1% over there. 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass! OK Jerry enough. Im not buying it. Youre damn right youre not buying it! You shouldnt have to try. Its just being open. Im open. Theres just nothing in there. Sarcastically) Uh huh. Oh you think Im lying about this? I think you are. Well Im not. Yes you are liar. Oh stop it. OK liar. Thats enough! Ooh that was good. Really? It felt good. Congratulations Mr. Lippman. Oh Elaine. My boys a man today. Can you believe it? Hes a man. Oh congratulations Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine) Im a man! Tongue? Yeah. Wow! I didnt try that til I was 23. Well this kids not just a man. Hes a mans man. And I think hes been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings) Hello? Yeah this is Jerry Seinfeld. No no no I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well then you upgrade me. Thats right you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey Im flyin first class. Where did that come from? Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that? No. Good. All right relax tough guy. I got to go out to my fathers garage help him sell some computers. What? The two of you workin in that garage is like a steel cage death match. Kramer. Yeah. What-what are you doing? Oh Im putting up Franks screen door. This beautys got a little life in her yet. What do you need it for? (Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown USA. Lets see how this baby closes. Oh yeah yeah yeah. Morning ma. (From another room ) Youre late! Morning dad. Im not dad in the workplace. My professional name is Mr. Costanza and I will refer to you as Costanza. Morning Braun. (Handing Frank coffee) Morning George. Two cream no sugar. What is Lloyd Braun doing here? Your mother recommended him. Yeah of course she did. Thats all I ever heard growing up is Why cant you be more like Lloyd Braun? Did you know he was in a mental institution? I didnt read his resume. (Ringing the sale bell) Another sale Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on the big board. (Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this? (Drawing a zero under Georges name) This is your lagging. Good work Braun. (From another room) Good for you Lloyd! So Adam I just talked to your father and apology accepted. Im not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone. Yeah I know. Uh by the way could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday. Are you free Friday night? I am but that is not the point. You are thirteen and I am in my early... 20s. But Im a man. The rabbi said so. No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean half my friends arent even there yet. Well if Im not a man then this whole thing was a sham! First they said I was gonna get great gifts and then somebody gives me Boggle. I renounce my religion! Who wants cookies? As of this moment I am no longer Jewish. I quit! What? (Eating) Walnuts mmmmmm. nan Youre late again Costanza so listen up. Starting tonight were having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired the winner gets a Waterpik. (From another room) Youre not giving away our Waterpik! Serenity now! You know what? It doesnt matter because I quit! I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles) You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now! Adam you dont become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience experience. Uh several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man. (Storming out of the room) Well that does me a lot of good. Early 20s! Well Im sorry sir I tried. So thats the type of guy youre looking for? Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her) (Surveying Kramers hall patio ) What is this? (Knocking on Kramers door) Anytown U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh hey. (Spraying his flowers) Hello neighbor. Boy those azaleas are really coming in nicely. Oh you gotta mulch. Youve got to. You barbecuing tonight? (Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks. So where do you want to eat tonight? How about La Caridad again? Again!? How much flan can a person eat!? Jerry youve been yelling at me all afternoon. Well I dont think more flan is the answer! Maybe I should just leave. Maybe!? Good-bye! Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves open door reveals Kramer sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler) Hey buddy! (Coming in Jerrys apartment) Hey. Happy New Year! (Getting the door slammed on him) Yall come back reeeaall... Did you and Patty just break up? Yeah! In fact she broke up with me! And I dont want to talk about it! Well then youre free tonight. You know what I heard about this great place called La Caridad. Thats the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also but I wasnt in the mood. Whoa. What is the matter? Its Patty. Jerry you break up with a girl every week. (Crying) What--what is this salty discharge? Oh my God. Youre crying. This is horrible! I care! Patty wont call me back. I dont know if I can live without her. Shes really gotten to you hasnt she? I dont know whats happening to me. Simple. You let out one emotion all the rest will come with it. Its like Endoras box. That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora. Yeah well she... had one too. (George enters) Jerry can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerrys apartment) (Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) Thats it thats it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time Im keepin it. And youre not getting back your rock either! (hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. Its just a chick. You ever heard of a little thing called feelings? Well I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn and stock quotes. Porn quotes... Im so lucky to have a friend like you George. Ever tell you how much I love you? What? I love you George. Come here. I-Im already here. Im here. Im here. Uh you know what? If you want a computer call me. I-I gotta go. Go wherever you want. Im still gonna love you. Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds and they put shaving cream all over my door. You I see you! Ill teach these kids a lesson. Wheres that house I put under your sink? Hose under my sink. I love *you* Kramer! I love you too buddy and George-- I dont want to hear it Kramer! Listen when I give you the signal I want you to turn this water on full blast. What signal? What-what signal? Ill yell uh Hoochie mama! If I do it will you buy a computer? On the signal George. On the signal. Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale. I love you Costanza. Will you shut up?! Now! Now George! Turn on the faucet! George turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa! So now the *other* Lippman kissed me. Well sure. Theyre Jewish and youre a shiksa. What? It means a non-Jewish woman. I know what it means but what does being a shiksa have to do with it? Youve got shiksappeal. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman thats not like their mother. Oh thats insane. Ill tell you whats insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer. I am not buying a computer from you. Theres porn. (Pausing) Even so. Damn it! Dont get me wrong Mr. Lippman. I-Im very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because Im a shiksa. Thats simply not true. If you werent Jewish you wouldnt be interested in me. You are wrong. Ill prove it. Oh no. Dont! I renounce Judaism! Oy vey! What happened to you pal? Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of Grade As. Are you all right? Oh no. Im fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now. So youre using Franks relaxation method? (Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry the anger it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now! (Enters) Hey what happened to you? Serenity! (He exits) Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at? Sit down Elaine. Oh no. Jerry I cant take any more gentle sobbing. Ive been thinking about what it means to be complete. Do you have an apple or anything? Look at us hurtling through space on this big blue marble. Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine. Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning... Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh banana! When all the while the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us! What? Elaine... (Entering Jerrys apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry Ive found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself I store em in your apartment. Then after I win the contest I bring em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! Its brilliant. What? Whats wrong with your leg? Im asking Elaine to marry me. (Leaving) Ill store these over at Kramers apartment. Elaine? Uhh Jerry Ive got a lot goin on with uh Lippman right now. Lippman? (Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah and him too. What?! Oh yeah! I think George is calling me so Im gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on! Can I help you? No. Stay! Stay. Stay. Hey Braun Costanzas kicking your butt! (using the phone) Watch how its done. Oh hello Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh really? Two dozen? Costanza youre white hot! If youd like to make a call please hang up and-- Hey Braun I got good news and bad news. And theyre both the same: youre fired. Costanza youve won the water pik! Youre not gonna give away that water pik! You wanna bet? Serenity now serenity now! You know you should tell your dad that serenity now thing doesnt work. It just bottles up the anger and eventually you blow. What do you know? You were in the nut house. What do you think put me there? I heard they found a family in your freezer Serenity now. Insanity later. What happened here Kramer? Serenity now serenity now... Kramer! Geez! Jerry I didnt here you come in. Yeah the children theyve done sum redecorating. Serenity now serenity now. You dont look well. Well thats odd cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now serenity now serenity now. Oh Im sorry. Look at me I stepped on your last rose. (going into his apartment) Jerry come on. Dont get upset about it. Theres always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww! Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun! (crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now! Come on wanna give me a hand with the computers? (Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww! Why couldnt you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers? (Leaving) George you listen to me. I owe ya one. Hes incorrigible. You want to talk about it? Oh please dont tell me you love me again Jerry I cant handle it. George letting my emotions out was the best thing Ive ever done. Sure Im not funny anymore but theres more to life than making shallow fairly-obvious observations. How about you? All right... here goes... Rabbi is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal? Ha! Elaine shiks-appeal is a myth like the Yeti or his North American cousin the Sasquatch. Well somethings goin on here cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop. Elaine theres much you dont understand about the Jewish religion. For example did you know that rabbis are allowed to date? (About to leave) Well what does that have to do...? You know a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Perhaps if youre not too busy we could wing on down after the High Holidays? Elaine? Lainie? So thats it. All of my darkest fears and... everything Im capable of. Thats me. Yikes. Well good look with all that. Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion. I think you scared me straight. All right Jerome Im in. What? Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... lets do it. I tell ya I dont see it happening. What? What happened to the new Jerry? He doesnt work here anymore. Oh well thats just *great!* I love you Jerry. (Leaving) Right back at ya Slick. You know all these years Ive always wanted to see the two of you get back together. Well thats because youre an idiot. You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of bankruptcy. Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales? Hes crazy. His phone wasnt even hooked up. He just liked ringing that bell. I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car in! This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here. Serenity now! All right... Dad you really should lay off the serenity now stuff. So what am I supposed to say? Hoochie mama? Move your crap Im comin in! No youre not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!]
156,9,4,[Are you sure you cant stay longer? No we just came for the funeral. ` Poor Marvin Kessler he went too early. He was 96 years old. That had nothing to do with it the man was out of shape. Thats why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week. And every morning I eat a plum. Well what ever you do youre wearing me out. What about you? Yeah looks like youre getting a little spare tire there tiger. Really? Hey Seinfelds! Hey Mr. Kramer! How long are you staying? We just came down for a funeral. Oh yeah yeah I heard Marvin Kessler. Boy that makes you think. If he could go... See you downstairs with the car. Are you sure you dont need a hand with that? No no the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here. Did you give blood? No not giving. hoarding. Im storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case. In case of what? Jerry I know myself. If Im out on the street and its starts to go down I dont back off until its finished. Are we finished? Done. Elaine Im so glad you came out. Yeah... You havent seen Jimmy for years. I know Im glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got you know all lurchy and awkward. Actually Im gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening. Tomorrow evening sure. Do you know anyone responsible? Do I know anyone?? Well if you think of anybody give me a call. What are you doing? Incense for the mood. Oh yes by no means the mood. Let me know if theres anything I can do to lend support to the mood. Um cream soda? Vanilla. Can you believe that Vivian doesnt think Im responsible? Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong the first thing they ask is: whos responsible for this? I couldnt raise a kid? Come on I love bossing people around. What happened I thought you were with Tara tonight? I was I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts all I could think about was food I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding! You just left? What did you tell her? I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour. What? I dont know I was starving Jerry! Oh pudding! You want some? Hey you guys think Im getting a little...chunky? What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top you know like your mother used to make it on the stove. Elaine what do you think? I think youre getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well maybe Ill just take my blood elsewhere yeah. Well we can transfer to another bank for you. Oh no no no...no more banks. Im keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money! So eh what do you say? I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking. Ok we got your...got your strawberries your chocolate sauce your pastrami on rye with mustard your honey... Wait wait wait pastrami on rye with mustard? Oh yeah yeah dont you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? No. Well maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was it worked! Didnt go for it huh? No. So she didnt appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats? She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce but eh its not a meal you know? Food and sex those are my two passions. Its only natural to combine them. Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman not a man and a sandwich. Jerry Im not suggesting getting rid of the girl. Shes integral. Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs how about satisfying one of somebody elses. Hey speaking of which I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife. I told you George no more pudding. Im starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. Well I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.) What the hell is that? Pudding skin singles. Hey buddy Im borrowing all your Tupperware. Oh why? I closed down my account at the blood bank. What it...its here in the building? Right across the hall. What you wanna go see? No I dont! In fact if even one corpuscles of that blood should find its way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out. You know for a fat guy youre not very jolly. Hey working out? You know it and I ditched all my junk food. What the heck is going on here? Sorry buddy clean house. Its all health food. Well I may have to take it but I dont have to like it. Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone. Is this about me? No. Oh then I lost interest.

Well I guess this would be all right. Jimmy you remember Elaine? Shes gonna watch you tonight. Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.) Hey what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivians. There was an incident. Oh no wheres the blood? (opens the fridge) Its in here isnt it? Would you stop it. What is this? Its Jell-O. What about this? This is blood isnt it?! This is tomato juice look...(drinks from the bottle.) Ooh youre sick! Youre sick!! Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newmans. He let me put it in his meat freezer. Hey whats going on? Who made pudding? Oh yeah yeah George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. Theyre delicious. Damn that George I told him I dont want this stuff around here anymore... Heads up! Aaah... Youre dead president Lincoln! Youre dead! I wish I was dead. Can I have your juice?

I wish I could do this every day. Oh Elaine thats so good to hear. Ive been having a few health problems lately. Its not serious is it? Well it might be. Just in case anything does happen its nice to know theres somebody like you around. Oh yeah that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.) Aah! Its ok Jerry. Im right here. I can see that! What happened? That knife it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry when somebody yells heads up youre not supposed to actually look up. Ill remember that. Anyway you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood. What? Oh yeah youve got three pints of Kramer in you buddy. Three pints of Kramers blood? I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood. Well so much for purification week. So hows the fornicating gourmet? Doing quite well thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation that would really be the ultimate. George were trying to have a civilization here. Hey. Hey how was baby-sitting? Oh just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. Oh Im sure it wont be the worst. It doesnt matter. If anything happens to her Im on deck! Scissors mishap air show disaster chinese organ thieves...its a dangerous world. Shes right I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig. Really? Look at this look at the hair on the back of my neck. Its all bramble see its like thicket back there. Look I need somebody to shave it for me huh? Im not touching that thing. Well I have to say Im very surprised and disappointed - blood brother. Oh no... What? Jerry I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... Kramer Im not shaving your neck. So my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too because Ill give it to you? Ill rip it out right here and stack it on the table! All right all right Ill do it sit down. No no no I dont have time right now. Ill catch you tonight well do sort of an all over kind of thing all right? Hello? Kramer called he told that you were in a hospital. Kramer called you? He calls every week. Are you all right? Yes Im fine. He says hes fine. Tell him to eat a plum. Jerry you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer. I dont need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right Ive got to go well talk about this later. Plum...(Jerry hangs up.) Why are you calling my parents? Well maybe if you called more often I wouldnt have to. Listen is it all right if I watch a tape in here? Why here? Well Im taping Canadian Parliament you know on C-Span. Ok... Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom cause your bed is really nice? Fine... Ok! No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! Blood! All right. Hello dough boy. Mr. Mandelbaum? Youre the personal trainer?

I dont know I dont know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you Im no good watching that kid. Sleeping like an angel. Elaine youre the best. No! Im a scatter brain. Thats why I probably cant hold a job or keep a man! Be quiet. So will you watch Jimmy tomorrow? All right but Im running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.) Ok Mr. Mandelbaum what you want me to do? Dont get puss honey and pick up that medicine ball. Is this a gym or some kind of fitness museum? Not funny over your head with it. Are you ready? For what? All aboard in the pain train! How many session did my parents paid for? Not enough to make a man of you daffodil. Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho youre hot tonight! Oh George! And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.) George? George? What are you doing?! (Pulls the covers off. George is eating a sandwich and watching TV.) Pleasuring you? What is this? Were making sausages. I thought you were gonna watch a video. Yeah an instructional video about how to make your own sausages. Kramer Im not in a mood for this. All right all right. Newman lets go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here. Blood over there sausages over here. Im living in a slaughter house. Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. (Looks at the sausages) What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet? No theyre not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... Dont lie to me butter bean. Were taking it up a notch. So the free love buffet is over? I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami. Yeah thats what you did...I cant believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum hes probably makes me box a kangaroo. Whats going on? I dont know. This sandwich is making me flush. Oh no Ill tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. I think youre right. You gonna eat that? No but please tell me thats all youre gonna do with it. Jerry I tell you; if this woman dies it is going to be a major inconvenience. These fries are really really good... All right thats enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.) I mean I cant shake this woman. You know now I have to go to Jimmys birthday party. Uuh sleepy. No matter what I do I cannot weasel out of raising this kid. Well sleepy here is quite a weasel maybe he can bat for you. Yeah thats what I need; a pinch weasel. Why did you get rid of that sausage? It wasnt me it was Mr. Mandelbaum. Yeah well Newmans not happy he booted me out of his freezer. Look Ive got to take my blood back to the bank can I borrow your car? Whats wrong with yours? I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or itll go bad. All right but this is it this is the last favor were even! All right Even Steven. Oh by the way when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed. Oh man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) If the engine begins to overheat turn off air conditioner. Never I cant do that. Oh mama... Shees come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.) Vivian... Elaine! Hi! This is my friend George. Hi... Im gonna go say hi to Jimmy. Ok. (whispering to George) Youre up. Oh isnt Elaine fantastic? Yes she is. Its a pity we wont be seeing much more of her. Really why? Oh you havent heard shes going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania. Her grandparent passed away five years ago. Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland. Shes American citizen I have seen her passport. All right no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project. I havent heard anything about another Biosphere. Thats because its underwater. This is insane. Is it? Yes it it. Well its all for charity so whats the difference. You...very knowledgeable. Well Im also an architect. Is that pastrami? Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry? Very. Oh wait...(Vivian turns the TV on.) Oohh... Vivian!! Is this really necessary? If you wanna live in a butcher shop Im gonna treat you like a piece of meat. What if I cant keep up? You lie you dry. Fire it up son. Move it move it! Get those knees up! Come on kick it kick it! Whats going on? Oh my God the blood! Get up boy get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real youve got to want it... So how long did they drag you? Well for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin it. Hi George. Hi Jimmy. Yeah Jimmy why dont you wait outside you know play with something. Ouch! Whats the kid doing here? Im baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesnt make it. Oh thats a drag... That kid... You put blood in the car?! Jerry it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing. Well they told me that I got more blood so I guess I owe you again. You didnt get the blood from me. Then who? Hello Jerry. Aaaaahhh...!!! Aaaahhh...!!! Aaaaahhh...!!!]

You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman. Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy. Why? Hes harmless. Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me. He was not the summer you. Besides you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris. I made him up. So you never saw Last Tango in Paris? No. Too bad. It was erotic. (enters) Well... Ive had it with these jackbooted thugs! Pottery Barn? I got three Pottery Barn catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month. (holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think shed go out with me? Why dont you just throw em out? Oh no. Ive been saving them up here in your apartment. And now its payback time. Pottery Barn is in for a world of hurt. (taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite? I cant. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks. So call now. I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes a few you-were-right-abouts. Its a whole procedure. Wasnt Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset? Thats him. Is he still nuts? What do you think?

Whatever happened to him? Nothing. Uh I dont know. I gotta go. So this is beautiful. You and Puddy and this new guy in a big pot of love stew. Oh yeah... Puddy.

I cant stop all these companies so Im gonna attack this problem at the choke point. Stop the mail? Thats... even better! Jerry! Hey Frankie! So wheres the car? This is it. Inside the van? It is the van! Dont you remember we always talked about how cool it would be to have a van and just drive? We were ten. Come on. Lets take it for a spin. I dont want a van. Well just tell him you want the SAAB. You dont understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp if you upset him hed run out to the woods dig a hole and sit in it. Well I have an idea. Keep the van and get a bumper sticker that says If this vans a-rockin dont come a-knockin. Always helpful. Oh Georgie what are you doing here? Just dropped in for a visit. You uh you never called me back. Uh... the phone broke. Well we got to get moving. What? Where are you going? We have a catered affair. Youre going like that?

(to the cashier) Can I use your phone? Sure. (in the van with Jerry) Nice captains chairs huh? Aye aye. Oh theres a spot. Just back up. Hold on. There must be a truck backing up. No thats us. Great. You know Frankie I was wondering. What if I decided that its silly to drive a van because you know I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it? You dont like the van? No no no. Just hypothetically. I gotta go to the park. No! No you dont! No woods. I love the van. Im a van guy. (showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them but lets see them get by... these bricks. Whered you get the bricks? Jerry the whole building is brick. So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? Im gonna try to sell the van to a lot. A dealer? Are you insane? No take out an ad. Sell it privately. I dont think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van. Come on Jerry just let me help you. OK. All right! OK! Right here we go. Yeah. OK so... For sale. A big juicy van. And ooh you gotta put down interesting trades considered. I dont want to trade. No you dont have to. Its all about tickling their buying bone. Hey you know what? This is all your mail. Theyre puttin it in my box now. Oh thats it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them. Hey Jerry. Id like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jacks face) May I help you? Yeah Id like to cancel my mail. Certainly. How long would you like us to hold it? Oh no no. I dont think you get me. I want out permanently. Ill handle this Violet. Why dont you take your three hour break? Oh calm down everyone. No ones cancelling any mail. Oh yes I am. What about your bills? The bank can pay em. The bank. What about your cards and letters? E-mail telephones fax machines. Fedex telex telegrams holograms. All right its true! Of course nobody needs mail. What do you think youre so clever for figuring that out? But you dont know the half of what goes on here. So just walk away Kramer. I beg of you. Is everything all right here Postal Employee Newman? Yes sir I believe everything is all squared away. Isnt it Mr. Kramer? Oh yeah. As long as I stop getting mail! (surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back. Oh! Quick for a... catered affair. I dont know what you mean. You ditched me. Thats twice. Now I demand to know whats going on! George weve had it with you. Understand? We love you like a son but even parents have limits. The breakups the firings. And every Sunday with the calls. What my wife is trying to say is that this is supposed to be our time. Im not following. Were cuttin you lose. Youre cuttin me loose? Now if youll excuse me Im going to make love to your mother. They dont want to see me anymore! But this is what youve always wanted. It is. Im just not ready yet. Aw thats kind of sweet. Ah shut up Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well they better think again. Oh no. George please. What are you going to do? You remember my cousin Rhisa? Im gonna date her. Mother of God. One little wink. Shell freak out tell my parents. Theyll be all over me. Who is this guy? That guy Elaines dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute what is this? That is the guy! Elaines in love with the Wiz guy? No she thinks shes in love with him. But shes just remembering this old commercial. Thats pretty pathetic. I know. Theyre not even related. (enters) Hey. Uh... hey. Im gonna get going. Hey have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So what do you know about this Jack fellow? Isnt he the best? Yeah nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do? Oh right now hes a fact checker for New York Magazine. Its not much but it has a certain type of quiet dignity. (turning on the commercial) Right quiet dignity. As opposed to say this? Oh no. Oh yes. (answering the phone) Hello? Yeah the van is still for sale. Sure come on buy. (rushing into Jerrys apartment) Yeah I called about the van. (at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot? Yeah thanks. Sure. You know Rhisa. Ive always found you... very attractive. What? I know it may sound shocking. But I just cant stop myself from... wanting you. You want to borrow money right? No no. I-I just want us to be... together. All right. All right? Lets go for it. Well... we could dance around it a little first. (playing footsie) Nah. Lets be bad George. Lets be really... bad. Whoa! Whoa! Geez! (inspecting Jerrys van) So how come youre selling it? You know why Im selling it. I hate it. How many miles? Two. City or highway? Look do you really want to buy this thing or what? (breaking the antenna) Hey hey. Take it easy. Im not gonna be pressured. Ill walk away right now. Is this thing bent? Im not paying for that. All right just get out of here. All right look. Im going to be honest. Im very interested in the van. OK fine. What do I have to do to put you in this van today? (pointing to the newspaper ad) Well I dont really have any money. But it says right here interesting trades considered. You put that in! (pulling out an undershirt) And Im glad I did. Here. You want to trade me an undershirt? No I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinns undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it. Thats disgusting. Well its my final offer. You dumped me for some idiotic TV pitchman. Look Im sorry Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So lets just put it behind us and we can continue like this never happened. Gee I dont know. What if were out somewhere and you see the Maytag repairman. Youre not taking me back? (leaving) Thats right. Hes not idiotic. Hes the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody... (handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey mail blows. Fax it to a friend. Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head? Because were blind to their tyranny. Then shouldnt you be wearing the bucket? Yeah. Move along Betty. Is this uh Jerry Seinfelds van? Well not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia. Im uh Im so stupid. What? (running away) Im so stupid. Uh excuse me. Im sorry. Yeah nice to meet you. Shes into it? Shes leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine. So have your parents found out about it? She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together. Brave new world alright. (entering Monks) Hey you guys. Hey hows the anti-mail campaign going? Oh its fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today and not one person went in. Its Sunday. Why is the mailman wearing a bucket? Huh? Well it symbolizes our persecution. Then... shouldnt you be wearing the bucket. Hey I want my van keys back. Oh well. I uh thought we made a deal for Quinns t-shirt. Are you insane? Give em to me. No I cant I cant. See I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah he wants to move some of Georges stuff into storage. Wait a minute? Hes picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. Ill drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open Im in the van kissing his brothers daughter. Oh listen Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels. Oh no not Frankie. Well I didnt catch his name but then he went running into the park. Oh no the woods! The hole! (seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey. Kramer what the hell are you doing? I know Im gonna switch the bucket to something else. Not that! What? Youre in trouble Kramer. I shouldnt even be talking to you but Im telling you as a friend. Heres how its going to happen: you may be walking. Maybe on a crisp autumn day just like today. When a mail truck will slow beside you and a door will open and a mailman you know maybe even trust will offer to give you a lift. Are you through? No! And no one will ever see you again! Are you through? Yes. No wait! OK yes. (seeing postal security officials walking towards Kramer) Quick! Get in! Oh no no no. Thats exactly how you said it was going down. Theres another way it can go down and its going down right now! No. You said a mailman I know and youre a mailman I know! I know you know but you dont know what I know. (being grabbed by the security officials) Hey! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie is that you? My name is Edgar. Have a nice night. Thank you. (digging a hole talking to himself and seeing Jerrys van pull up near him) Stupid... so stupid! Jerry? All right George. Im ready. Yeah hold on. Im uh Im just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents? Geor-gie... (running up to the van and yelling through the window) Is this Seinfelds van? Seinfelds van? Seinfelds van?! (hearing Frankie as George runs to the back of the van) Wait. Whats he saying? I think hes saying Son of Sam! Oh my God! No they caught him. (running out and away from the van) I knew it wasnt Berkowitz! (seeing George running away) Ohh... So I told him Hit the road. Im going back with Jack. Elaine thats the second piece of good news today. Really what was the first? (pulling out his Wiz hat) Theyre bringing me back. Yeah. Im the Wiz again. What? (dancing around) Im the Wiz! Im the Wiz! Well what what about your fact-checking job? (dancing around) Oh... heres a fact. Uh Im... the Wiz! Im the Wiz and noooobody beats me! (finding Frankie in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there. You hate the van. But Im keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy its much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people. So can we go for a ride? Yeah lets just get out of here. (coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked. Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods? Isnt it obvious? There are no parking meters out here. (looking inside of the van) Wow! (reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey look at this. Hoochie mama! Oh my goodness. What have they done to you here? Huh? Who are you? Well you can just call me Henry. Henry Atkins? The postmaster general? Last time I checked. Henry... can I get out of here now? Oh oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean after all I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you. Oh? I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf Mr. Kramer? Yeah. Kramer Ive been uh reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. I mean just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs door to door. Yeah! Ha ha. Well its my job. And Im pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster Im a general. And we both know its the job of a general to by God get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf. Im very very sorry. Sure youre sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now you want that mail dont you Mr. Kramer? Sure do! (receiving a salute from Kramer) Now thats better. (seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman? (whimpering) Tell the world my story. Hey George! Jerry! Hey thats the guy! What? George Costanza Frankie Merman. Oh. The summer me. The winter me. You must be Georges cousin. Girlfriend. All right. (seeing Jerrys van shaking) What is that? That vans a-rockin. Dont go a-knockin. (after George opens the van door) Oh my god! (seeing his parents being intimate) Oh my god! Now you gotta sell this van. Oh yeah. What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a mans love for his lady. Ohhhh... Your fathers right. Its beautiful. And it was safe. Oh God... Now if youll excuse me. Once again your mother and I... Oh... make it stop.]
158,9,6,[I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it. Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able. Yeah ya know Cain slew Able. No he didnt. They were in business together... it was dry wall or somethin. Oh no. All right then what was it? Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts so he killed him. The way I remember it Cain he was a successful doctor but when he took this special formula he became Mr. Able. Ya broke my blender didnt ya? Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out. I knew it. Why were you making gravel? Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it. Aahh this looks familiar... Of course. Its garbage. No no no no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian! Yeah at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian. Look at this. Boy one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - youre yesterdays trash. Come on Kramer get out of there. No no no. You go on ahead. Im not finished taking this in. Oh Jerry look ... Merv Griffins cigar. (moans) Ohhh (walks away) You know I uh spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm Cant smell anything can ya? Banana? Right. George watch out for those pigeons. Oh theyll get out of the way. You really smell banana? (gasp) Oh my God. (trying to catch her breath she puts her hand to her chest.) So uh... where we eating? And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate. Youre making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish. Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys) Oh yeah the toys. Where did you get all these? My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with... Super bowl! Hey an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit. Jerry what are you doing? Im putting this on him and were going to the sink. Ohhh Jerry. (takes them from Jerry and puts them back with the other toys) Theyre priceless. Theyve never been played with. I just want a touch em a little. I said no. Now come here. Hi (startled Elaine spills her coffee on her sleeve) Im Lou Filerman. Im new here. Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy? uh-Hes Lou Filerman. Hes new here. (exhales) Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro. Youve been an enormous help. You ran over some pigeons? How many? What ever they had. Miranda thinks Im a butcher but i-i-its not my fault is it? Dont we have a deal with the pigeons? Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars we look the other way on the statue defecation. Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this! So Mirandas cooled on ya? Im getting nothing. Yeah me neither. Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together? Oh the sex is wild but shes got this incredible toy collection and she wont let me near it! I dont understand women. Here comes one. Hey. Whats going on? Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel? No Castro. Right. All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and hes right next to you! So he just sidles up? Thats right! Hes a real sidler. (points at Jerry) Maybe you just didnt see him. Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from The Lion King. Hakuna Matata? I thought I was alone. That doesnt make it right. See to me the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup... Would you just let it go? (from his apartment) Hey Jerry! Come here a sec! Hey! (moving a chair onto the set) Oh my God! (Outstretched arms) Its the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times) How did you get this in here? Oh you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it. So where you gonna sleep? Yeah ... backstage. Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage. (putting on jacket) Oh well a lot of the stars from the 70s - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example. Im gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain) All right. Well Jerry wed love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out as if hes reaching out a good-bye) Well Elaine Benes! Well its great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you? (giggles) Ahh Ah-Ah...We had a deal! Mr. Peterman here are these pages that you wanted. One moment. Im reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd done. Oh yes. Im sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much you two. What? (with arms crossed she turns quickly and... ) So three dates and she still wont let me play with her toys. Hm Thats interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys growing up. Yeah that was me. Oh thats right right right. And uh you mentioned that uh you didnt get a G.I. Joe. You had an... An Army Pete. Right. He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split. And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.) Jerry. Oh there - - Oh Elaine Benes. Well this is quite a thrill yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes. (clears throat) (to Jerry) Well Ill tell ya this sidler guy is really chapping my hide. Ju - Excuse me. Yeah were talking this way. Well hes getting credit for work that I did! Hes gonna sidle me right out of a job. Ah Now for those of us who dont know uh sidling is what? Kramer what is wrong with you? What do you mean? Well for starters youre looking at note cards (to Jerry) Im gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine so I am going to sidle the sidler. You sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale! Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes! (to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha Jerry? Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well ladies and gentlemen! Its our good friend George Costanza! What a surprise! Turn Music Off (Kramer pushes the off button turning the music off) Yeah sit sit sit... Weeell! (laughing clapping) Well it happened again. What happened? Eyaaaya-ya-ya Ill ask the questions. What happened? Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didnt move. All right lets uh change the subject ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now uh you and uh Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like? That was the wrong card. I-I dont get these birds! Theyre breaking the deal. It-its like the pigeons decided to ignore me! So theyre like everyone else. (laughs too loudly) All right lets take a short break. ... Okay ah (checks his watch) Were back! Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off. Then why dont you just run IT over too? Zing. George what are you doing? Did you see that? That-that pigeon didnt move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life! What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel. (leaves the car) Squirrel? Well we have no deal with THEM! (sound of gunfire) Pkew pkew pkew pkew Pkeeew! Jerry! (she slides away from him) ... Those hands! They never stop! Im sorry. Got any booze? Whats say you and I get ripped! No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin? All right. Ohh will not cause drowsiness Heres the new copy you wanted. Ah yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. Im very impressed ... with both of you. (winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down) Unfortunately I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And Im assuming I need it right away. Well I guess well just have - (Lou has left) Ohh just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away) Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer veeer veeer veeer veeer veeer veeer veeer... A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base Joe. (singing) dee de-de de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off legs kicking) Doctor is the squirrel going to live? Theres been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but it would be costly difficult and wed have to send away for some special really tiny instruments. Well uh are there any other options? We could put him to sleep. What might that cost? Well its by the pound. So ... about 80 cents. Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - Im curious thats all. We uh. Wed like you to do everything possible. He um. Hes not going to be the same you know? Yeah. yeah. I-I know. So theyre flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso. El Paso? I spent a month there one night. (laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso! Whats he here for? eue-aaa. Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So Jerry ah whats going on with you? I understand theres a young lady in your life. mmm. Well actually its kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them. Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear wedding bells? Are you married right now? (points at Jerry) Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm) Actually she doesnt even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I guess she passed out! What do you mean wrong kind of medicine? Shes even got that old Mattel football game that we love! Oh come on! You gotta get me over there! Wait a minute wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Lets pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry now what you do with your personal life is your business but when youre on my set - you clean it up mister! I told you he was a risk. Oh like hes not just carrying you! And has been for years! Yeah? Well you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs! Smile everyone! Were back! You wanted to see me Elaine? Yes Lou. (exhales) Youve got a lot going for you. Youre um ... youre spontaneous. Youre symmetrical. Youre uh ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - youre very quick arent ya. Um Its just that your... My dead tooth? No. Your. (breathes) Not my breath? Uuhhh. What can I do? Well you should never ever go anywhere (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these. Thanks Elaine. Youre such a super lady! (he opens the door and goes into the hall - now he clicks and clacks when he walks) More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine) Hmm. (takes a sip) So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine I thought: ... What a coincidence. Were just about to eat. What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy? Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script) Ahh. ... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.) What video did you get? Oh. Oh George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan. Four hours. More heavy gravy? (playing with toys) Ahhhh Yes! Touch down! Your turn Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.) Lately though Ive been uh - Ive been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know I rip of the label... I can hardly tell the difference. Weve officially bottomed out mm. Whos our next guest? We got no one! We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool. What about a guest-host? Ill pretend I didnt hear that. Doctor hows the squirrel? Is he dead? No. Fortunately the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him? Yes he would. You uh You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor) So ... uh squirrel. One more thing Mister Costanza we just need to know what time youll be picking him up tomorrow. Whats that? Oh were discharging the squirrel. We think hell be better off at home. He has no home. Hes a squirrel. Hmm-hm. Your home Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits) Maybe itll be fun having a pet. Its not a pet! Its a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better its gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep! Jerry (claps) aaya - what are you doin tomorrow? I want you to come by the set. What about my questionable material? Nope we got a whole new format. Edgy youthful plus ... we got Jim Fowler! Jim Fowler? The animal guy from Wild Kingdom is coming to your apartment? Well I practically raised his kids. Thats perfect! Hes a zoo guy! He takes care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by? What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this amateur hour? Look George Im sorry maybe another time all right? (drums table and exits) I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. Its practically bionic! Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle huh? Speaking of which I think Ive got that problem solved. Tic-Tacs work? Hes a human maraca. Boy my knuckles are still cramped from that football game. You took him over to Celias? What? Its a victimless crime. What about the woman whos been drugged and taken advantage of? Okay one victim. I think its unconscionable. Hey last night I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven. EZ Bake oven? Who wants cupcake? Oh me me me me me! You know that batter is like 30 years old. (on TV) You step on it and it flushes. Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop? (on TV) Stop squirming. Oh dont look. T-This is the part where they change me. Youre like eight years old. (on TV) Georgie. I was seven and a half. That noise. Thats the noise! What? That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office in the hallway. Even in the mens room! Shame on you Elaine! No no Mr. Peterman that wasnt me! That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You havent gone over to their side have you? No Mister Peterman. Because if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - Ill find out about that too. (Exits) (pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk. Oh right. (Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these. Why? Because theyre turning your teeth green? I only buy the white ones. O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these okay? Just ... just mouth wash. I cant. It burns my cankers. Binaca? Again. Right right cankers. Um I got it! Chew gum! I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that 20 years ago. Well stinky this is your lucky day. Okay. A little later were gonna be talking with animal expert Jim Fowler. Where are the cameras? (he has a live Hawk perched on his arm) But first were talking with Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay Jerry uh you uh you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy collection. How do you feel about that? It was great! Ive done it a few more time since then. And she doesnt know anything about this? No not a thing. Well Jerry we have a little surprise for you! Come on out Celia! What kind of a sick twisted creep are you? Woah. What What is this? What is she doing here? Its the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt. If you think you can drug me and play with my toys you got another thing coming buddy! Go girl! Well what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine? Ohhh! Mister Fowler I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs) George I told you were booked! Careful. Hawks and squirrels dont get along together. Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah George bring him over. Uh. No you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels! Ahhhh Ahh Ah Ahhh Ahh Ah! (off camera) Are we getting this? So the whole set was destroyed? Well the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing. Well at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set. Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. Im not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set. I got the nut bread George. Lets go. (exits) So the squirrels gonna make it? Yeah hes in my bed. Im... sleeping on the couch. On the couch? So youre... Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. Im getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL! Im glad you called Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone. Oh well hey I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey? Whos he? (Lou) Oh hes nobody. Hey listen ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)]
159,9,7,[Hey. Morning. Look this is crazy I cant go on like this. But why? I need some space. Does that mean I have to go too? You dont think shes just talking to me? Hey shut up. You shut up. I hate this. Youll get used to it. Its like a grubby scrub. No I dont want this anymore. Well come to work with you. And on your dates. And shopping. And to the bathroom. Elaine Elaine Elaine Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.) I cant breath...Im sorry...(Elaine wakes up) Youre killing me! (Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams) Your background is impressive George but how does it apply to what we do here at Kruger Industrial Smoothing? Well at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over you know chiseling away grinding down. In fact we used to call it the grind. It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days? That should be 14 let me just...(corrects it with a pen.) George I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell we need someone huh. You wont regret this sir. I dont care. Lets find you an office. The boom box incident? Summer of 89 Im at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out my clothes my towel my umbrella theyre all gone. I am furious I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean. Seems reasonable. Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out not the kids. Even more reasonable. So now the father is screaming at me hes demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there. And that guy is your new boss? Until that stupid photo jogs his memory. Kruger? Thats not Kruger Industrial Smoothing is it? Yeah. Grinders sanders wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job. Right they couldnt get the green stuff off. It is a horrible company. Theres no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there. You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed. Like retouched. You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there. Oh this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I cant wait to work for him. Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this... I havent had a decent sandwich in 13 years. Neither have I. Hey our meat problems are solved. Where did you get this thing? I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is see thats all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide. Hey. Hey spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country. Yeah thats pretty good. Hey I got a date with that doctor you met. Sara Sitarides? Mmhu. Oh...(falls in to the sofa.) Whats with you? You remember that next door neighbor of mine the apartment that always smells like potatoes? Your whole building smells like potatoes. This jackass goes to Paris leaves the alarm on. Its been beeping since 3:30 this morning. You know that happened to Lomez so he blew his neighbors circuit. How do you do that? Yeah well thats easy. Just let me finish this mile high and Ill be right with you. Oh and Jerry we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls. I think we might have one left in the stock room. This hallway smells like potatoes. I know I know this is it. (points to a door.) Ok oh you see this socket its probably connected to her apartment. So what well do well take this paper clip and bend it so itll short out the entire circuit. Here you go... I think Ill let you do it. No no no. Its easy you just...do it quickly. No I really dont want to. Well I dont want to either. I thought you had done this before. Its just...its no picnic. Well how are we gonna do it? Alright fine fine Ill do it. Oh mama. Are you okay? I will lose that nail. I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what its like to have someones life depending on you. Well I have this neighbor... A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someones life? Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? No. Cause I hit a whopper last week! Here you go airbrushed in to sand and sky. What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy. I thought you said you wanted to be out? Well Im still here. You took out the other guy! Youve really lost a lot of hair. I am aware! The cat. He took out Kruger? I just pray Kruger doesnt realize that its gone until this guy can fix it up. This slicer is indomitable. Where did you get that butchers coat? You buy enough meat theyll give you anything. Kramer my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power we mustve shut off the automatic feeder. See thats the same thing that happened to Lomez. What did he do about it? Well he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. Well this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. Oh thats a prickly one. Yeah hows the doctor date? Eh died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel if I dont save lives Im worthless. Well shes very focused. Dermatology is her life. Dermatology? Yes shes a dermatologist. Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh just put some aloe on it. The slicer! Elaine lets go. Where are we going? The cat. Just grab that meat and lets ride. When are you going on your next date with her? Oh whats the point? What youre gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place? Revenge date? That sound like you more than me. This good be so sweet Jerry. Saving lives? Shes one step away working at the clinique counter! Dermatologist? Skin doesnt need a doctor! Of course not! Wash it dry it move on! Youre right. Im gonna call her right now and tell her off. No no no no no this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner flowers... Flowers? Yeah you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.) So youve done this? Almost. Couldnt get the girl go out with me the second time. I think we are looking half a millimeter. Can it cut that thin? Oh Ive cut slices so thin I couldnt even see them. How did you know you cut it? Well I guess I just assumed. Hold on kitty dinners coming. Yeah thats a hall of famer. Alright lets do it. Alright here we go. Yeah watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.) Come on come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow can I borrow that thing for a while? Oh no I dont think so. Why not? Well youre not checked at on it. What do I have to know? Well where the meat goes? Right there. Where do you turn it on? Right there. But where does the meat go? Restaurant flowers...this is so nice. Well Im a classy guy. Hows the life saving business? Its fine. It must take a really really big zit to kill a man! What is with you? You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! Dr. Sitarides? Mr. Parry how are you? I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life. She saved your life? I had skin cancer. Skin cancer! Damn. You were right Kramer this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah yeah...no no no Ill bring it by tonight...ok bye. These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.) Here you Mr. Costanza. What is this? This is a drawing. Looks real doesnt it? This is a cartoon! Hey I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering I think thats damn good. But its not a photograph I need a photograph! Then you better get a camera. He looks like a Peanuts character. I know. The only way to fix it now is to get a whole new photo of Kruger. You can do that. Without his shirt on. You cant do that. Well maybe Kruger wasnt the place for you. It seemed so disorganized. I understand. What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there a lot of tradition. True. You mean for you? I think. What about your sea sickness? Maybe I could be a land guy. I dont know if they have land guys. Someones have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place! Pliers? Drawer. Got it. What are they for? I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. Come again? Okay I got a little slicer happy but listen; dont tell Kramer okay? He has very strong feelings for it. I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? Eh it went okay. Did you dressed nice did you do it classy? Yeah I started out real classy... Yeah you did you classed it up! But then I found out about the skin cancer. Oh so it backfired? Yeah. So I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. Of course she treats skin cancer. Thats how I met her she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. Thats what dermatologists do. Sadly that knowledge couldve help me. Wait a minute she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? Aha. Could she do that at Kruger? I dont know I guess. So I set up a screening everyone takes their shirt off and click I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. You have a little thing for this fella? Jerry you gotta talk to Sitarides. Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! And that was wrong Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. Must I? Yes! Because it is the mature adult thing to do. How does that reflect me? Elaine alright wheres the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. Aah I forgot it. I gotta get home. Ok Ill go with you. Umm Im not actually going straight to home I have to first stop at the eh...circus you know with all the...clowns. Oh well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns. So again Im sorry. I had no right to yell at you youre a life saving doctor and Im just a comedian... Jerry enough. Ill do your friends cancer screening because I believe in that but as far as you and I are concerned; its off. Was it pimple popper MD? Thats the one. (Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.) Still got it. Out damn heal! Elaine? Kramer? Yeah listen I need my slicer back. Just hold on! Hey whats going on? Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here ok Im on the phone alright? Im on the phone with someone... My blade is all dinged up. Oh come on! Elaine! Phone call! Im in a big phone call! Come on this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.) Hey get the hell out of here! Wow thats a lot of potatoes. So George took my slicer down to Kruger and theyre smoothing it out for me. What the hell is this? Boy that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard? No. Well what have you been doing? Nothing I got up run some errands I went down to Saras office and apologized... Whoa whoa backup Dr. Sitarides what happened there? Well I tried to apologise it didnt go over that well... There theres your hives. What she gave me hives? Jerry as the Bible says; Thou who cureth can maketh ill. She did kind of touch my face. Now you listen to me youve got to find this woman and tell her that youre not a test tube pin cushion. It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her. Alright great because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey and I couldnt find that stock room. Oh thats fantastic. I just talked to Mr. Kruger hell be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record. What record? His personal file I I dont ask... Jerry? What brings you here? I dont know this? (Shows his neck to Sara.) Looks like hives. Where do you suppose that couldve come from? Jerry what are you doing... He is just setting the record straight. Come on Sitarides cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice? Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose? I want the antidote pimple popper! Thats it Im out of here! Youre insane. Am I? You touched my face. I didnt imagine that! Dr. Sitarides dont go! Oh thanks Jerry! Hey George hey Doc. We doing the screening here? Aah yeah yeah. Wont you head on in well be in in a second. Be right with you. Doc huh? Kramer this is perfect. I need you to go in there pretend youre a doctor and check this guy for moles. Moles yes. Freckles ugly cousin. And get a picture of him with his shirt off. You really are cooking up a little scheme here arent you? Alright lets get in there. Quick quick quick... This is it. I can take this anymore. Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok Mr. Kruger we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if youll stand up please and give me a big smile oh no no no not that big. Yeah thats nice yes okay. Yes lets have a looksee...ok so eh fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. Im gonna have to keep my on that. How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand? Uuh long long time. Yes Ive seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men. So how am I looking? Oh so far so good...(looks at Mr. Krugers shoulder) yeuye... Kramer I really owe you one. George we got a problem. What? Well hes got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. So tell him youre concerned about it and he should see someone else. George why would I a Juilliard trained dermatologist send him to another doctor? Because youre not a dermatologist. He thinks I am. Im not gonna betray that trust. Heres what I wanna do; I think I can get a section... Whoa whoa a section?! Yeah if I could crab my slicer and hed hold still... No youre not taking a deli slicer to my boss... Itll be operative thing he would barely feel it. No! Absolutely Not! Well its my medical opinion that youre making a big mistake. And its going in my chart. Yeah hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh finally listen I need someone to come over here right away! Turn it off! Turn it off! I am getting a lock smith alright?! Relax! Alright thats it! Yeah the address is 78th West... Oh oh mama... So Kramer pulled it off? Yep and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk no thanks to you. Well that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck it looks like I had a beard of bees! Why dont you see someone about it? Ive called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist. (Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma. Youre not a doctor. You shouldnt even have books like this. George thats what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean. You cant tell him the truth youre gonna blow the whole thing. I dont want this on my conscience. Ill get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this. Yeah alright... Hey I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. Theyve got everything there Jerry. I underlined the best parts. Hey this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene a common ingredient in metal cleaners. Well thats weird. What are you doing? Well Im cleaning my slicer. Thats my hand towel! I use that on my face hands and chest! Thats where the hives are coming from! Its not from Dr. Sitarides its from Dr. Van Nostrand! So somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison shes giving you. Alright get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.) Ohh thats toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramers head.) Ououou.... George come in. Im just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year. Eh listen Mr. Kruger I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole. Im not too worried about it. Well he said it could be cancer maybe you should get it checked out. George take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So theres no cause for concern eh? Whatever. Actually funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser. Well that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo until I broke in here stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there! Well Ill be...you have lost a lot of hair. Thats what they tell me! Do you want more pastrami? Um what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good. Yeah it was olive loaf. You want that? I cant believe Kruger didnt fire you after all you did. He said he didnt care. Oh God I love that place. Hey have you seen other dermatologist? Yeah I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad. What did he give you for it. Aloe. So wheres that lock smith? Have to give him time on this hour. Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.) Oh yeah coming up...]
160,9,8,[So Elaine are you going to sleep with me or what?! (Aggravated) George I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. Im too tired to even vomit at the thought. (Angered) Fine. Ill ask you again when youre rested. (Sarcastic) Oh Im sure shell come around. Yeah I hope so. For your sake! (To George) I said I was sorry. You can stuff you sorries in a sack mister! (Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?! (Confused) What is up with you two? I dont want to talk about it. (To Jerry) So how was the big trip? I dont want to talk about it! (Observing Elaines bandaged nose) Well what happened to your nose? I dont want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word about) Well you gotta give me something! Come on how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant? She.. was. Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom. (Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen I gotta go to the bathroom but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom) (While skimming a Monks menu) You know I didnt go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India. I cant believe we went all the way to India for a wedding! Thats it! The weddings off. What? But Sue Ellen- (Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?! No no no! It was years ago - before you met him. And and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical. I have never been so humiliated! (To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault! (While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me! (Pleading) George Im sorry. Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack Mister! (Confused) I dont know what that means. (To his girlfriend) Nina you have to decide right now. Jerry or me? (Casually) Alright.. Neither. What?! Well what are you doing here? A free trip to India. And by the way you can take off those boots. Everyone knows youre five six. Five eight! Five seven! (To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! Were - were still best friends right? No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaines nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose! Thats got to hurt I dont care where youre from! (Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom. (Whispering to Jerry) Hey. Hey. What happened last night? Oh you were pretty loaded. (Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this. Oh. Hello Tetanus. George Ive used the bathroom. Its fine. (Struggling) No no no no. I can walk it off. Its a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. Ill sweat it out. (Seeing George she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black? (Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced? (Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom) Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerrys. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina. (As George sits down) George we need to talk. (Trying to keep his voice down) I think youve done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me! Alright I admit it. I slept with Nina but thats all. (Outraged) Thats all?! Thats everything! I dont know what all the rest of it is for anyway! (Pleading) Im really sorry. You can stuff your sorries in a sack mister! (Confused) Whered you get that one? Its an expression. (From the front of the room she can hear George and Jerrys heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself then shakes her head - apologizing) (Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. Thats the only way to punish you! That doesnt punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly I might add. (Losing it) Funny guy! Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here! Elaine you have to sleep with me. (Definite) Im not gonna sleep with you. Reparations! Would you grow up George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry) he slept with me I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! Its all ancient history. (Loud so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?! Oh thank you FDR! All right now were even. I-I-I stuck a rock in there too. All right. Alright FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win you get your wish - I drop dead. I win I dont drop dead and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever. Alright. Oh man! All right come on. Theres got to be something thatll change your mind FDR. Something.. (FDR lifts up a cooler and puts it on the table) What you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!.. George knows that you slept with Nina. Thats why he was acting so weird. How did he find out? He schnapped me. You know youre not supposed to drink while youre keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else? I cant tell you. (Handing her a small bottle) Here drink this. Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom. Pinter? He used to be called Peter. (Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that? Sue Ellen! If she knew shed call off the whole wedding. Oh nobodys calling off any weddings. Alright its time to go. Come on.. Up. Do you know what Jerry is in Indian? (Carrying her out piggy-back style) No what? (Between laughs) Jugdish. Yes Jugdish. Hey what if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor) (Trying to get rid of her) Yes I think its a fine idea. Well good night. Gnight Jugdish. (Laughs) Bless you. Thank you...aah hm mm. ah Hello FDR. Yeah Ill have a hot one (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it. These thingsll kill ya... but so what...(squirts mustard on the hot dog)Youre already gonna drop dead (grins) Well guess what FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night and I wished against your wish. Thats funny. As it happens I saw the same shooting star and double-wished you to drop dead. (clicks out some coins from his changer and hands them to Kramer) Heres your change. Alright Im triple-wishing! Yep! (Throwing four coins into the fountain) Then Im quadruple-wishing! Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya! I like it a lot. (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ow! (Blows it away) (Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away) (Doing the same) Oh! (Blows it away) Oh God its so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell? (Joking around) I think its the stench of death. George youve been wearing those boots since I met you. Youre not gonna wear them to the wedding are you? No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... Im gonna wear black shoes. (Sees her enemy Sue Ellen at the airport) Oh boy. Theres Sue Ellen. She didnt want me at this wedding but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends! (Giddy) This is gonna be great! (Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh I am so happy to see you! (Confused by her reaction) You are? Well of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean not even Pinters parents - and theyre Indian. Come on Sue Ellen. You dont wear a bra youre tall... we hate each other! Elaine I know. I know weve had our problems but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend. (Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess. Uh this is my fianc&eacute; Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello. (Walking up to them) Hello. (Recognizing him) Peter? Uh no. Its Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom? (Leading Nina out the airport) Oh no. No. Were good. Lets get goin. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it funny man. (Leaves) Elaine have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight? (Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I.. (Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey look what they had on the plane. Schnapps. Ooohh. Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) Theres one! (Yelling out) I wish I dont drop dead!! (Off-screen) Hey shut up up there! You shut up! Aw drop dead! Hello friend. Enjoying the flight? Coach to India - The only way to go. (Heavily sarcastic. Hes angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. Youre very funny Jerry. Thats what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfelds a funny guy! You all right? Of course Im all right. Im here with my girl Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade. (Joking around) Hey didnt I beat you up in the fourth grade? (Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here! By the way you never said anything to George about Jerry and me did ya? Oh please.. Its in the vault. Ho ha ho! Jerry Seinfelds a funny guy! Hey what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle) You just asked me two minutes ago. Hey what time is it? Ah Im not wearing a watch. Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth) Yeah. Howd ya do that? I have no idea. Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth flips her head up drinking it then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink:) Oh.. God.. So Jerry and Nina huh? Oh Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) Im not gonna tell you any - more - things. (points at George) You already told me everything. Okey-dokey. I mean we had a deal Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now youve wasted it! (With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I? Newman Im bored. Aww.. Does your girlfriend have to be here? (Suggesting Jerry) Does yours? (Giving Newman a sour look) Im just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George. Alright come on Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR? Why dont you just make another wish? And how am I gonna do that Toots? What about a shooting star? (Interested) Thats perfect. (Kissing the woman) Beauty .. and brains. (they nuzzle noses) (Disgusted. To the woman) Oh come on. You know hes a postman dont ya? Heres your plane ticket. What are you talking about. Sue Ellen sends me an invitation one week before her wedding in India. Tst Ill show her... By flying half way around the world? Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina) Hey. (Handing George a ticket) Here. Youre going to India with us tomorrow. For how long? Three days. Great. Jerry I gotta tell you I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think Im in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great great friend. (Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in! (Shrugging Jerry off) Nah. You want to go to India? I cant. (Complaining) Im gonna drop dead. Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go huh? Jerry this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina. H-Hey Kramer wait up. Ill go with you. Im goin to Newmans! Great I love Newman! (Eagerly following Kramer) (Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina? Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina. Why do you keep saying Nina? I dont know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling shes said to much she goes to leave) Im gonna go grab a bite. Uhh.. Ill- Ill meet you down there. (Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on Lomez! Were gonna be late for the movie. (To his new girlfriend) You see my dear all certified mail is registered but registered mail is not necessarily certified. I could listen to you talk about mail all day. Anything you wish. Ill tell you a little secret about zip codes: Theyre meaningless! (Laughs evilly driving away) Wish?! Newman! Lomez Im Leavin (Singing to Newman) ..And you smell like one too. (laughing and clapping) Make a wish Newman! Weve gotta get back to work in three hours! Newman wait! (Stands up and Sputtering loudly) Kramer! Im with people. Yeah yeah. And thanks for inviting me! I did invite you. Your invitation mustve gotten ... lost in the mail. Well Newman I need your wish to protect me from FDR. Cant do it. Im on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true. Come on! Look Ill give you my next birthday wish huh? (Negotiating) Your next fifty wishes. Forty-eight. Fourty-nine. Done! (Together) Sucker.. Alright alright back savages. Back! I havent made my wish yet.. Well Ahh this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin worse. Uh-huh. I talked with the grooms parents.. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.. ... And its so obvious that they dont want.. Uh-huh.. ... me to go. Sure. So the only reason ... Uh-huh. ... she sent me an invitation was that so Id send her a gift. Uh-huh. (From Jerrys room) Jerry? (To Elaine) Uh well you know a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee. Oh. Hi. Hi. (Getting ready to leave) Oh I should... um... Sure. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye. (Leaves) (Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there? Look there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before. You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George? Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. Itll crush him. Uh. Alright alright. Ill put it in the vault. No good. Too many people know the combination. (Confused) What combination? Dont be ridiculous. Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops! So what? And milk. Oh geez.. (From outside the apartment) Hello? Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat? Please call us Usha and Zubin. Oh. Well Usha. Im Zubin. (Shrugging it off) Anyway your son is marrying my friend Sue Ellen Mischke. Youre not going to the wedding are you? Well ... Dont go. India is a dreadful dreadful place. You know its the only country that still has the plague? (laughing as he says the line) I mean the plague! Please! Heres the registry. Send her a gift and be glad you did not have to go. (Soaking it in) Right. Dont go. Send a gift. I think I understand. If I had to go to India I wouldnt go to the bathroom the entire trip. (Leaving) Thats fantastic. And Im not so crazy about Manhattan either. Oh you were going to tell me all about George. Ah just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him. Really? Believe me. You know I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you. I know. You know we never had a bad conversation. I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around.. Heh.. yeah. Probably the reason.. Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead! (Slams the door in Kramers face *Note: FDRs Apt. #548*) (Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry.. Kramer I know what Im talking about. Theres no way FDR wants you to drop dead. But you havent seen.. Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer) Yeah.. (Heads for FDRs) Thats right. My birthday wish was that you drop dead. Well why? (Sinister) I have my reasons. Woah wait wait wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud it doesnt come true. Thats just a silly superstition. (Slams his door on Kramer) Hey FDR wants me to drop dead. FDR? (To George) Yeah Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part and just before he blew out his candles he gives me this look.. (Guessing the look) Stink eye? (Also guessing) Crook eye? EVIL eye. Well everybodys a little cranky on their birthday. Oh its a bad day. Uh you got everyone in your house youre thinkin These are my friends?! Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said) Yeah well I cant have this hanging over my head. Its bad mojo. Hi. Youre not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischkes wedding. (Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well at least the wedding gown will give her some support. Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today. So you think its a non-vite? Its an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey are you gettin taller? Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots) Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey look at this. Pinter Ranawat.. I wonder if hes related to that guy I dated Peter Ranawat.. Ah its probably like Smith over there. Jerry would you make the call already? What call? He wants me to set him up with this girl Nina Stengal. (Remembers Jerrys talking about her) Oh the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me? I was kidding when I said that! (To Elaine) Told me the same thing. (On the phone) Nina Hi. Its Jerry. You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head no) Perfect. (To Nina) Hey how bout my friend George? Quite a guy huh? (Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Somethings not sitting right.. Ill have the Clams Casino. Get outta here. (Showing Jerry the menu) Chef recommends Hmm.. (Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me. Sure. So how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man? Are you? Well whats the reason? We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing. How engrossing? If we ever had a problem with Elaine we could bring in Nina and not lose a step. Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You dont huh have a replacement lined up for me do ya? heh he he he he he... Anyway like I was saying I couldnt make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause. Im all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her. Why? In any other shoe I lose two inches. I - I cant have a drop down. We were eye to eye I cant go eye to chin! So youre gonna wear em no matter what the situation? In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky. Oh Im sure its fine. ..to you! Come on make a wish! Make a wish! Yeah! Heyyy yeahhhh (Clapping). Ah this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive. Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey new Timberlands? Yeah and a whole new me. Im up two inches in these babies! Really? Five eight. Five seven. Jerry? Nina? Hi. Its been years! Yeah! (Introducing the two) George this is Nina. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. (Reading an invitation) India? Tst Yeah right. (Sarcastic) Im goin to India.. And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone! (Mesmerized) What are you a scientist?! Ah I gotta go. (Gets up to leave) Ah. Its great talkin Great talkin to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail? How as the date? Pretty good. I think she might be the one. No. Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries. Ah George. (clearing his throat he changes his order for Susan) Baked uh potato. Uh-huh. Sorry. Yeah you stuff your sorries in a sack mister. Hey hey. Yeah check it out. Its packin tight! (Puts the snowball on the table then drips water from Jerrys cup onto it) What are you bringing snowballs in here for? Oh I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look (FDR is at the cash register pays and leaves Monks) theres my friend FDR. Im gonna nail him in the back of the head. Its gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball) Hi Elaine. Hey! (Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey lets go someplace else Okay Peter? Oh hey how you doing? Oh hi. I-Im Jerry Seinfeld. Im movin in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler. Uh no. Actually its Kramer. Oh. Uh you need any help or..? No thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it? Ah no no no. I-I couldnt impose. Why not? Were neighbors. Whats mine is yours. (And with that Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life) (quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerrys empty apartment) Really?]
161,9,9,[(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa waffles are ready. (appearing in the kitchen stark naked) Oh fantastic! Im starving. (looking at her) How about that. (eating the waffles) Mmm-hmm. She ate breakfast naked? She didnt even want a napkin. Ive had bedroom naked Ive had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked. Oh its a scene. Its like youre livin in the Playboy Mansion! Did she uh did she frolic? I dont really have enough room. (seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monks) Yeah. Hey Lainie Puddy. Hey! Hi. Hey. (heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop. (sitting down in the booth) Kay. Back together? His apartment was being fumigated so we thought wed give it another shot. Ah... So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke. Stanky Hanke? What did he want? He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago. Why now? A.A. Its one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone youve ever wronged. Ho ho ho ho! I cant wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me. Still with the neck hole? Still upset. Very upset. What neck hole? Remember that New Years party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment you know I think on Ninth Avenue. I asked if I could borrow a sweater. A cashmere sweater. I said preferably cashmere for warmth. So in front of the whole party he says No. I dont want you stretching out the neck hole. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh yeah sure laugh it up. Everybody else did! Well its funny. I mean you have a big head. Or is it cause of your neck? No I think the head does most of the stretching. Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now it is payback time. I really think its the size of your neck. Its my head! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hey. Hey. Isnt this great? With those nerds in accounting moved you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom. (somewhat sarcastically) Yeah. Great. You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya I just wanted to hop in the shower. That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there? Showering. How long does it take you? Ten minutes. (seeing Elaine come into Jerrys apartment) Ten minutes? Thats kooky talk. Hey Elaine how long do you spend in the shower? Ten minutes. Let me smell you. All right. Whiff away. (after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... thats not bad at all. (holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! Thats it. (backing off) OK. So get this. Im in the bathroom at work today and I see Peggy using a seat protector. So? So... were the only women on the floor. I mean were like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate? (seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramers inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! Ill get that. Well maybe she just practices good hygiene. (eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah youre probably right. Shes probably one of those neurotic clean freaks. Mmm. Well heres my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap and just... -pop- focus! (playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word. Do you challenge? No I do not challenge. 66 points. Ha ha. Id accuse you of cheating but I dont know where youd hide the tiles. You want some more ice tea? Sure. (coughing loudly while Jerrys expression turns to disgust) Wrong pipe. So she coughed. Coughing... naked... Its a turn-off man. Everything goes with naked. When you cough there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. Its like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion. Oh you spoiled spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked? But the thing you dont realize is that theres good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing good; naked crouching bad. Hey theres Hanke. All right. Its grovel time. Hey George. Jerry. Listen I just got sober so Ive been going through the Twelve Steps. What are you up to now uh Step Nine? Yeah. Making amends. Important step. Maybe the most important. Anyway uh Jerry you know this may sound dumb but you know when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times and... I dont know if you noticed but I always felt bad about it so Im sorry. Thank you. I did notice and I appreciate you rectifying it. (eyeing George whos looking expectedly up at him) Great. Great. Well Ill see you guys later. (enters) Well I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts and I didnt lose anything I needed. Yeah I think what I kept is even stronger now. (pointing to Kramers hair) You got some suds over here. (noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh man! Geez! Look at that! Im all lathery. Jerry you got to show me what Im doing wrong. Oh come on! No I mean it man. Im lost! You promise youll never come in here again? (chuckling) Oh Jerry you know I cant do that. (standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that youre probably wasting time working piecemeal first cleaning one area then another. Well thats how cats do it. But when you have a faucet instead of a tongue you want to use gravity. OK. Lets turn the water on now. No I told you its just a dry run. (entering Jerrys bathroom) Well Hankes moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory. Thats Step Ten? All he has to do now is count his blessings say a prayer and hes done. Do you believe this? Come on Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit? Youre not gettin any skin Kramer. Well this has all been one big tease! (moving Peggys water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work. (having seen Elaine touch her nearly full water bottle) Im... gonna get another bottle of water. (taking a final swig from his own water bottle) Here take mine. Theres a little left. (gulping down Walters water) Oh thanks Walter. Ahh! (talking with two men in Monks) Guys theres no doubt that the pay is good. But I dont just know if I see myself working with ice cream. I dont know if Im into that. (entering Monks) Oh hello Hanke others. George. You know Jason I uh I couldnt help notice I... I didnt get my apology. Apology? For what? A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker? George come on not that neck hole thing. Yeah the neck hole thing and I would appreciate it if you would say youre sorry. No way you wouldve completely stretched it out. Youre an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine. All right George all right. Im sorry. Im very very sorry. Im so sorry that I didnt want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater. (taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see thats smart. Constant motion. Wow. (seeing Kramer staring at the showering man) Hey! Oh yeah yeah I-Im watching you too. But this guys really showing me something! (walking into Jerrys apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak? What happened to you? Ah people in this city are crazy. (giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go. (applying the steak to his eye) Thanks buddy. Oh... yes! Hey you got any A1 cause Im cooking a steak. What? Yeah a different one. (closing the door on him) Oh! Jerry! (wheeling out Jerrys bicycle) OK Jerry. I fixed that bike. Oh. That wasnt really necessary. I dont ride it. Its just for show. (crouching down next to the bike) I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk. Please dont crouch. Ouch! Caught my skin. Oh thats bad. Especially that area. You got anything to snack on? Uhh... (grabbing the pickle jar and straining to open it) Oh pickles! Unnhhhh! Its a tough one. Look please stop! Let me help you with that! (finally opening the jar) Unnnnh! Oooh. Thats gonna leave a welt. Look at that. (leaving the room) I cant. I cant look anymore. I-I-Ive seen too much. Peggy weve got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive? You seem to be with a lot of men. What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know I mean we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there but wh-why is this your business? Its not. Good day. (leaving the room after rubbing Peggys keyboard on her butt sticking the stapler in her armpit and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think Ive got germs? Ill give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard huh? Huh? Oooh how about for your stapler. Hmmm? Thats good isnt it? You have a happy and a healthy. Well technically he did apologize. Jerry I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain! So now you want an apology for the apology plus the original apology? Thats right. Im two in the hole! Well I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar. Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked? Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball? Well... what if you showed up bad naked huh? You still got that belt sander? Yeah. (going into the bathroom) Well you on all fours that thing vibratin kickin up sawdust ho ho! Shell get the picture! (answering the ringing phone) Hello? Hey Jerry guess where Im calling from! World War I plane? No Im in my shower. Well you know Im trying to get out of the shower sooner and then I ask myself Why? I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone I shaved I brushed my teeth and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew. When are ya gettin out? Im not! Ill see ya later buddy. Bad news people. Peggy is home sick. Oh please. Shes stuffed up achy and suffering from intense malaise. Oh come on we all have intense malaise. Right? I just spoke with her Elaine. Shes in bed. Yeah let me tell you something: this is all in her mind OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob rubbed her stapler in my armpit and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah shes a wacko. So youre Jason Hankes supervisor? Sponsor. Whatever. Listen Im very concerned about this guy. Hes doing very well. Hes already on to Step Ten. Yeah well when you dont actually do the steps you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day. Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason? I dont know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology he was beboppin and scattin all over me. Im not sure what you want me to do. Well arent you the boss of him? You shouldnt let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts I got stuck on Weebolos for three years cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby. Youre quite upset George. Well I think you should drop him down to Step Two. Admit theres a higher power? Yeah let him chew on that for a while. All right. Thats more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the be strong hand clench) By the way my uncle was an alcoholic so... (on the phone in the shower) Lomez youre not listenin. Jerry likes the naked just some of the things she does when shes naked. Calm down Im on your side. Geez. Hey hold on a second. I got a clog Ill call ya back. (naked on the couch) What are you doing? (naked carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor I thought Id polish it up with this belt sander I have here. No not that. Why are you naked? I thought naked is good. (eyeing him) This isnt good naked. George here have a seat. (sitting down) Wheres Hanke? (motioning to the leader) Shhhhh. OK lets get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous. What? Rate-aholics? George this can help you. Hey I am not here for rage. Im here for revenge. Excuse me. We have a no yelling policy at these meetings. Excuse me. Am I talking to you Pinhead? Am I?! Please dont call me Pinhead. Im losin it! He took you to Rage-aholics? Why? Probably because this whole Universe is against me! Youve got a little rage. I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad! By the way my bad naked demo didnt quite work. This bread has nuts in it! (seeing Elaine enter Monks) Oh great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body? Chicken wing shoulder blades. Thats it? No but thats one problem. Why? Well I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day-- Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man. Why not? Its a good look for a woman. Well the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian its for gettin around like a jeep. So you dont think its attractive? Its hideous. The hair the... the lumpiness. Its simian. Well some women like it. Hmm. Sickies. (in the shower reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh come on Clarkman. (staring into space picks up the phone) Puddy. Is uh David Puddy there? This is Puddy. Well this is Kramer. I know. Um listen youre a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal? Well its a big job. Youve got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line. No. It says main line. Its a misprint. What do you got a Clarkman? Yeah. (seeing Elaine come in) Hey man Ill call you back. Ill talk you through it. Oh OK. Well thanks buddy. Hey Puddy. Hey Babe your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him. Balloon bouquet? For who? Peggy took a turn for the worst. Peggy. Oh great. I suppose shes still blaming me? Thats what he said. I dont believe this woman. Talk to me Babe. Shes this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick. Oh germ-o-phobe. I know what thats about. Huh? (showing her his necklace) Im a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years. What is this symbol? Its a germ. Elaine it was very nice of you to bring the man youre currently sleeping with over to talk to me but I assure you I dont have any problem with germs. Dont you? Elaine. (flinching away) Please! I know it looks bleak. Ive been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this wouldve sent me running for the Phisohex. Really? I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in. Hey Ive had those since college. Theyre bunnies. Theyre bacteria traps.

I kept trying to picture her naked she kept trying to not picture me naked. Hang on. So what are you up to? Oh just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey how do you make those radish roses? Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then to make it bloom soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes. No problem there. George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away but my hours here arent very flexible. I just started yesterday. Well Im here. What is it? Well I talked to my sponsor and uh Ive thought it over and you know my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic and rude and you deserve much better. (ready to leave) Well thank you. Youre welcome. (entering the store) Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint? Waffle or sugar cone? Uh excuse me uh um Jason. I dont want to get into a big thing here but... Im not sure if technically what you just said was actually an apology. What? Can you get on that cone? Would you hang on just a second son? George what are you talking about? Well its just all you said was your welcome which is nice. Its very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology. Is there anybody else here but you? Im alone and its my second day. You know I dont even think we have that flavor so... George really enough ok? You know I-I admitted I was wrong so what more do you want from me? I would like an apology. All right look you know-- No this guy doesnt know what hes doing. Oh yes I do. Yes I do. OK? Im interacting with someone here if you can understand that. Now Im sorry. Baah! There it is! You just said it! Thats what I want! Now say it again and tell it to me. Im not saying anything to you. Im not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Wheres that Rum Raisin?

Uh this is my first meeting. Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine! Please. Step Nine. Thats right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater. It wasnt funny. It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I dont know if Id trust him with a v-neck. Hes beboppin and scattin and Im losin it!]

I got a card and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain. What does that mean? (Embarrassed) Free sub. What? Nothing. Its a card from my dad. What is it? (Grabs the card from George he tries to stop her but fails. She reads it out loud.) Dear son Happy Festivus. What is Festivus? Its nothing stop it.. When George was growing up.. (Interrupting) Jerry No! His father.. No! Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas so he made up his own holiday. Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place. (pleading) Alright.. And instead of a tree didnt your father put up an aluminum pole? Jerry! Stop it! And werent there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying? I cant take it anymore! Im going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically) Oh I cant believe it! Ive lost my Atomic Sub card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest! So? Ive eaten 23 bad subs I just need 1 more! Its like a long bad movie but you want to see the end of it! No you walk out. Alright then its like a boring book but you gotta finish it. No you wait for the movie! (Irritated and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub. You dont need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that its all computerized! (Snaps) Theyre cloning sheep now. (Correcting) No theyre not cloning sheep. Its the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show! So why dont you just try your blow-off number and see if hes called it? Thats a good idea. (Answering phone) Yeah Go! Wha.. really? Yeah ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah the strike has been settled. Im going back to work. What strike? Yeah H&H Bagels. Thats where I worked. You? Worked? Bagels? Yeah. Look see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out hands it to Elaine) Yeah weve been on strike for 12 years. Oh I remember seeing those guys picketing out there but I havent seen them in a long time. Yeah well H&H wouldnt let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity. What were your.. demands? Yeah 5.35 an hour. And thats what theyre paying now. I believe thats the new minimum wage. Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright Ive got to go. (Heads for the door) Why didnt you ever mention this? Jerry I didnt want you to know I was out of work. Its embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends) All right everybody! Im back! Who are you? Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over. Oh yeah! Kramer. Huh.. wha- Didnt any of the guys come back? NO Im sure they all got jobs.. like ten years ago. Oh man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.. I could use someone for the holidays.. Alright! Toss me an apron lets bagel! (Takes off his coat puts it in the display case then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those? Those are rasin bagels. (Picks one up hes mesmerized) I never thought Id live to see that.. So anyway Ive been giving out your number as my standard fake. So. Youre Elaine Benes. Weve been getting calls fro you for 5 years. So listen when this guy calls if you could just give him my real number.. (Interrupting) Hey Charlie! Guess whos here. Elaine Benes. Elaine Benes?! You make a lot of man friends. You know whos a man? Charlie here hes a man. You know who else? Me. Im a man. (faintly) Im a man. Ohh.. my.. Ill have this best guy call your real number. You just uh give it to me. And that way Ill have it. (Slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down) My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramers business card) Okay.. Uh well there you go. (writes H&Hs number down) And uh tell you what..

Gwen? Yeah. (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really? Yeah! Come on our table is ready. So attractive one day - not attractive the next? Have you come across this? Yes I am familiar with this syndrome -- shes a two-face. (Relating) Like the Batman villain? (Annoyed) If that helps you.. So if I ask her out again - I dont know whos showing up: The good the bad or the ugly. (Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood! Yeah. Hey check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger so Im pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry) (Reading it) A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund. - What is that? (With pride) Made it up. (Continuing reading) The Human Fund. Money for people. What do you think? It has a certain understated stupidity. (Once again Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales! ..Yeah. Ah gentlemen.. bagels on the house! How was your first day? Oh fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough. Your hands were in the dough? No I didnt make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah theyre day-olds. The homeless wont even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top but they dig.. they they test. Alright. Uh well Im out of here. (Gets up to leave) Happy Festivus! Whats Festivus? When George was growing up.. (Interrupting) No! His father.. Stop it! Its nothing. Its a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesnt exist! Happy Festivus Georgie. Frank invented a holiday? Hes so prolific! Kramer listen I got a little phone relay going so if a guy calls H&H and hes looking for me you take a message. Youre still trying to gget that free sub? Hey! I have spent a lot of time and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now. Is there a captains hat involved in this? Maybe. Kramer I got your message. I havent celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest? Well just tell me everything huh? Many Christmases ago I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him I realized there had to be another way! What happened to the doll? It was destroyed. But out of that a new holiday was born. A Festivus for the rest of us! That musta been some kind of doll. She was. Merry Christmas Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card) (After reading the cheap gift shes suddenly unimpressed) ..Oh.. thanks. (Walks off) Phil I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil) Ow! Aw Mr. Kruger Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card) Not if you could see our books.. whats this? The Human Fund. Whatever. (Walks off) Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica! And at the Festivus dinner you gather your family around and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year. Is there a tree? No. Instead theres a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting. Frank this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch. Lets do it then! Festivus is back! Ill get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave meets up with Elaine) Hello Frank. Hello woman. (leaves) Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest? No. (To manager of H&H) Ah listen Harry I need the 23rd off. Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays. But its Festivus. What? You know youre infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays.. Thats not a right. Well its going to be! Because Im going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron and goes for his coat) Its a walk out! No I got to stay here and wait for the call. What? Youre siding with management?! No I just.. (Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab! Hey. Boy am I glad to see you. You were expecting someone else? You never know. (To driver) You know you might want to take the tunnel. So uh what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian? I can go either way. (Shocked) Youre telling me. So she was switching? Back and forth? Actually the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there. So just bring her here. This is all you really need. I cant just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean what if things you know progress? Lights out. Alright Ill give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links by the way. (Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you this Human Fund is a gold mine! Thats not a french cuff shirt you know. I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener. Oh thats classy. Well Happy Festivus. What is that? Is taht the pole?! George Festivus is your heritage - its part of who you are. (Sulking) Thats why I hate it. Theres a big dinner Tuesday night at Franks house - everyones invited. George youre forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard) Read that poem. (Complaining) I cant read it. I need my glasses! You dont need glasses youre just weak! Youre weak! Leave him alone! Alright George. Its time for the feats of strength. No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus! We had some good times. Hey. I there. This is Kramer and Frank. Hi. (Shocked at her ugliness he stammers) Hello. So you ready to go? Uh why dont we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth. Protect Festivus! Hey no bagels no bagels no bagels (Continues to chant) (To a waiting Elaine) Lady if you want a sandwich Ill make you a sandwich. (Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) Ill get it. Ill get it! (Into phone) H&H and Elaine. (From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. Its going down. What did you do? Youve been warned. Oh hi! (Waves at him) Hey the steam valves broke. Can we still make bagels? Sure. Its just a little steamy. Hey! How do you like your bagels now?! George I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) Im suppose to find a charity and throw some of the companys money at it. They all seem the same to me so whats the difference? (Hands the check to George) 20 thousand dollars? Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office but its locked) Oh damn. Ive locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. Im going home. Jerry how many times do we have to come to this.. place? Why? Its our place. I just found a rubber band in my soup. Oh.. I know whos cooking today! Hey! Surprise surprise! Hey Georgie! I think Im just gonna go. Ill be here. (Sees Gwens meal) Hey soup. She didnt touch it. Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Krugers check) 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? Youre not keeping this. I dont know. Excuse me? Ive been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back. You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars. Im serious. Youre going to start your own charity? I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing Im gonna need is a driver.. Kramer the vest just called. (Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! Its fright night! Oh yeah I got a little steam bath. Listen in 10 minutes Im gonna have my hands on that Atomic Sub card. And? (Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) Ill see ya. Yeah. Kramer Hi! Oh hello. Its Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop. Ah-huh. Im dating your friend Jerry.. Ahh.. I dont know who you really are but Ive seen Jerrys girlfriend and shes not you. Youre much better looking - and like a foot taller. Thats why were always hiding in that coffee shop! Hes afraid of getting caught. Oh hes a tomcat. Steve. Hmm? Its Elaine. From Tim Whatleys party? Yeah. You look.. different. I see youre still sticking with the denim. (Hes wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you? Well I had it back at my place but I cant go there now.. Ill give it to you later or something. No no no. You give me your number. Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad and starts writing a number down) Do you have the mumps? No. Typhoid? No. (Hands her the paper and runs off) Yama - Hama! A fake number! Blimey! George we have a problem. Theres a memo here from accounting telling me theres no such thing as the Human Fund. Well there could be. But there isnt. Well I - I could Uh I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out) George I dont get it. If theres no Human Fund those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift. Well sir I - I gave out the fake card because um I dont really celebrate Christmas. I um I celebrate Festivus. Vemonous? Festivus Sir. And uh I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside Sir! Are you making all this up too? Oh no Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to. Yeah you probably should. Happy Festivus! George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Whos the suit? Yo dad. This is my boss Mr. Kruger. Have you seen the pole Kruger? Dad he doesnt need to see the pole. Hes gonna see it. Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama! I didnt have time to go home. What are you doing here? Embracing my roots. They nailed you on the 20 Gs? Busted cold. Its made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio. I find your belief system fascinating. Hey! Happy Festivus everyone! (Hugs George and jumps up and down) Hee hee hee! Hello again Miss Benes. What are you doing here? Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out and uh we got this bagel place.. (Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. Its a Festivus miracle! Dinners ready! Lets begin. Dr.. Van Nostrand? Uh.. thats right. Welcome new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now youre gonna hear about it! You Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks! Oh God. (To George) Quiet youll get yours in a minute. Kruger you couldnt smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought. Jerry! Gwen! Howd you know I was here? Kramer told me. Another Festivus miracle! I guess this is the ugly girl Ive been hearing about. Hey I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break. Gwen. Gwen wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch. (To bookie) Hey howd my horse do? He had to be shot. And now as Festivus rolls on we come to the feats of strength. Not the feats of strength.. This year the honor goes to Mr. Kramer. Uh-oh. Oh gee Frank Im sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H. I thought you were on strike? Well I caved. I mean I really had to use their bathroom. Frank no offence but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there. Kramer! You cant go! Whos gonna do the feats of strength? (Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George? Good thinking Kruger. Until you pin me George Festivus is not over! Oh please somebody stop this! (Taking off his sweater) Lets rumble! I think you can take him Georgie! Oh come on! Be sensible. Stop crying and fight your father! Ow! .. Ow! I give I give! Uncle! This is the best Festivus ever! Alright. Thats enough. Youre fired. Thank - you! (Gets his coat and leaves)]
163,9,11,[When are they gonna have the flying cars already? nan Yeah they have been promising that for a while.. nan Years.

That was a cool one. nan (Sarcastically) Whats the competition Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? nan Well what do you think the big holdup is? nan The government is very touchy about us being in the air.

Youll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey George Im buyin this car. (Gestures to a black Saab) Shhh... What is wrong with you? You never tell em you like the car.

(Pointing) Well make this next right and swing around to get back to the dealership. nan (Up to something) Well its a test drive right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car I need to see that itll handle my daily routine. nan Well where are we going? nan Just a little place I like to call Youll see. nan Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up? nan (Pointing out his office door) By the service department. nan (Getting up he addresses Jerry) All right remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble. nan (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir Le George. nan Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves) So Puddy this is a pretty good move for you huh? No more grease monkey. nan I dont care for that term. nan Oh. Sorry I didnt know.. nan No I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector. nan I saw one once that could do sign language. nan Yeah I saw that one. Uh..

(To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything did ya? nan No. We both just saw the same monkey. nan (Aggravated) Well I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh! nan (Standing up) Well theres a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves showing George the way) (To Jerry) Hey gimme a dollar. nan (Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money? nan (Talking it) Im here helpin you. nan Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken. nan (On his way out) Heh heh heh. Thats what they want you to think. nan Hey Elaine have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit? nan (Squints imitating Puddy) The squinting? nan No. nan (Stares ahead again imitating Puddy) The staring? nan No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. nan (Shrugging) I thought all guys do that. nan Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now. nan Its that bad? nan What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five. nan (Pointing out) Isnt that from your act like ten years ago? nan (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s and its still relatable today. nan Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five. nan Um David you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come. (Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five. nan Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5. nan Ah come on! nan Ah excuse me. Do you have uh change of a dollar? nan (While retrieving his candy) No. nan Could I uh could I trade you for another dollar? nan (While walking away) Dont have one. nan (Stopping him) Ah excuse me. When your uh when your wallet was open I - I glanced inside and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills. nan (Calm) Youre incorrect. nan (Persistent) Perhaps you could look again please? Im very hungry. nan (While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier. nan (Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho ho. What I would do with you.. nan Uh Mr. Kramer were really not allowed to use the cars to run errands. nan Now look Rick. Im very close to giving this car that my celebrity friend is considering my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez... (Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there. nan People can drop change down here Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up. nan Either that or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier? nan The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be. nan How much was under there? nan (Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel. nan (While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel) Ho ho ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in! nan Hey can I have my dollar back? nan (Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless. nan (As the Twix starts to move) Ha ha ha ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump! nan They just put out some more donuts. nan They did? nan (Holding his up) Last one. nan Well just one more errand and we can head back. nan Actually it looks like were gonna need some gas. nan Oh? Well how much gas do you think is in there right now? nan (Looking) Well its on E. nan You know Rick oftentimes Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But for a variety of reasons I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline. nan (Pointing out) So you want to know how far you can drive your friends car for free. nan (In the spotlight his voice goes high) Well I make it up to him in other ways. nan As you will see the candy bar is paid for and yet remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled Employees Only. The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it! nan Well how do you know that ones yours? nan Uh it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one and gotten both. nan Sir are you gonna buy a car? nan No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh ha ha! Ho ho! nan Paper jam.. Got it! nan Yay! (Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side. nan David um I.. nan (Still holding out his hand) Dont leave me hangin. nan Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is... its very grease monkey. What did I tell you about that? nan Ah I Im sorry but the high-five is just so stupid. nan (Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? Ill tell you whats stupid. You. Stupid. nan (Sarcastically) Oh that is really mature. nan Yeah? So are you. Youre the grease monkey. nan (Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh... that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving. nan Yeah if you leave were through. nan Fine! Were through! nan Oh so youre leaving? nan (While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys... (Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you...? nan Lets finish this up. nan Did you two break up? nan (While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chicks whacked. Were history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things: uh rust-proofing... Rust-proofing? nan (Reading off what hes adding up on the calculator) Transport charge storage surcharge additional overcharge finders fee... Finders fee? It was on the lot! nan Yeah thats right. (Continues reading off) Uh floor mats keys... Keys?! nan How ya gonna start it? nan Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar you got a little freebie and you never bothered to ask why or seek out its rightful owner. nan First of all it wasnt a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar. nan Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch. nan Its uh its just a little nougat. nan Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications. nan (Pointing to Georges forehead) You know youre gettin a little vein there.. nan (Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy.. nan Hey George! nan Hey starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry) No last one. Listen you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up hes treatin me just like a regular customer now! nan I tried to tell you but you wouldnt listen. No ho ho! You were gonna get a deal huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome! nan Is someone helping you? nan Stay back! (Runs out of the room pushing Jerry out ahead of him) (Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now? nan Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the E. nan How low are you gonna go? nan Oh Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind. nan Have you ever been completely below the slash? nan Well I almost did once and I blacked out. When I came to the car was in a ditch and the tank was full. I dont know who did it and I never got to thank them.. nan (As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer the road! nan Whoop! Whoop! nan (Threatening tone) So listen Puddy. When we first started this deal I thought things were gonna be different. Now if you want to play hard ball I got my friend George here and he can play pretty hard... ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George vein it up. nan All right Puddy listen and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?! nan George! Can we focus on the car here? nan Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine. nan (Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry I just need your signature here and well get you that yellow car ready to go. nan Yellow? I wanted black. nan I cant give you black at that price. nan (Pleading) George would you help me please? nan (Standing up) Yes. This is wrong! nan Sing it sister! nan Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch... (Exasperated) Oh God... (Losing it) ...does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe Sol or... Lem is not gonna get away with this! nan (To Puddy) Ill be right back. nan Okay. nan Hey George! nan Is it just the angle Im looking from? nan No Sir. We are down there. nan Oh this is amazing! Oh Ive never felt so alive! nan All right Im satisfied. We better get some gas. nan What? Well we cant stop now. nan What do you mean? nan We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan. nan There was no plan. nan Well lets make it the plan! Lets just... go for it! Like Thelma and Louise. nan What they drove to a dealership? nan No they drove off a cliff. nan You are one sick mama... I like it. nan Mr. Kramer the road! nan Yup! Yup! nan Hello? nan (Over the phone) Elaine youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car which is yellow now! nan (Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this? nan (Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine! nan What?! nan You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal. nan (Sarcastically) You know just that you cared enough to call means so much Jerry. nan Youre gonna get back together anyway. Its thousands of dollars! nan Oh I dont know.. nan Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15000-mile check. nan Well will you pay my cab fare out there? nan Fine. nan And I didnt like that roast beef so how bout some lunch? nan No. No lunch. nan Ill hang this phone up right now! nan All right! Lunch! nan Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone) Bye. (Hangs up) (Frustrated he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off! nan Yes Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics. nan When did you bring the car in? nan (To the man behind him in line) Yeah right... Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet? nan Sir what exactly is the problem? nan One of your guys - Kip or Ned short name - stole my Twix candy bar! nan Are you saying he grabbed your candy bar away from you? nan He might as well have! I caught him and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs. nan I thought you said it was a Twix. nan Oh it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar. nan Maybe it was. nan Oh no no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch. nan What about the Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar? nan No. Rice and caramel. nan Nougat? nan No. nan Positive? nan Please. nan You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand? nan All I want is my seventy-five cents back an apology and for him to be fired! nan I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel. nan Whats the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial? nan They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial! nan Not Skittles. nan Dad I told you you could sit here only if you dont talk. nan (Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day? nan He likes it! nan All right do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now what are you gonna do about my Twix? nan (In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut. nan No! Theres no coconut! nan (Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut. nan Im not. nan ...A nickel! nan Cab receipt. Hey Puddy. nan Im with a customer. nan Uh... No no. No Elaine the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh then well talk about the car. nan (Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes too bossy. nan (Raising her finger at him in an authoritative tone) David.. nan Okay. Now I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on come on. (All three sit down) Now look you both find each other attractive right? nan Right. nan Clearly no one else can stand to be with either one of you. nan I guess. nan Good point. nan (Smiling like a salesman) All right. Now what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today? nan Cars can go on empty but not us humans huh fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars. nan No no coconut for me. nan All right Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running. nan Ahh! nan No man! Not the gas! nan But it needs it Kramer! It needs it bad! nan Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont! nan (Walking away) Ah you can just go on without me. nan Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership and that tank is bone dry I want you to be there with me when everyone says Kramer and that other guy oh they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed! Maybe we better get moving. nan Its good to have you back Stan. nan Its Rick by the way. nan No time! nan Mr. Costanza I really dont have time for this. nan Now if this mechanic guy was in fact eating a 5th Avenue bar as he claims wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up? nan Candy line-up? nan Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from. nan It took you an hour? nan Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so without further ado I give you... the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars) Hey Willie check it out! Free candy! nan Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor! nan And you! How many Twix does that make for you today?! Like 8 Twix?! nan No. nan Hey this Clark bar is good. nan Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now gimme one! Gimme a Twix! nan Theyre all gone. nan (Yelling out frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx! nan What was that? nan Theres a mental hospital right near here. nan All right. Elaine David I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange Elaine comes to your softball game and doesnt read a book. nan (While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah well thats not bad. nan I can live with that. nan So youre back together? nan Yeah. nan All right all right. All right thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating thats a rip-off isnt it David? nan Oh we dont even know what it is. nan So Im gettin the insiders deal? nan Insiders deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five. nan (Seeing the turn-off up ahead) Theres the dealer! nan Hey! nan We did! We pulled it off! I cant believe it! Wheres the needle? nan Oh it broke off baby! Woo hoo hoo! nan Oh Mr. Kramer I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now. nan Well thats a weird thing to say... I wonder how much longer we could have lasted. nan Yeah yeah. I wonder... hmm. nan This is nice. What kind of car is this? nan Caprice Classic. nan (To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five? nan And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase Dont go there. - Someones gotta take a stand! nan (Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good. nan So George I still dont understand - how was that a setup? nan And who were you tryin to set up anyway? The mechanic or the manager? nan I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides I couldnt get all different candy bars anyway. nan What was that? nan I think theres a mental hospital near here. nan Very near. nan Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well I think we stopped. nan You - you can probably let go of my hand now. nan Yeah yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well Ill think about it.. nan Do you have my card? nan]
164,9,12,[Careful this plate is extremely hot. Thank you. Ow! I just told you it was hot. Whyd you touch it? I just wanted to know what your idea of hot is. Hey babe. You ready to hit the ice? I am ready to skate up a-- ha ha ha...Why are you wearing that? Its my winter coat. A fur? Is there a problem? A seemingly infinite supply. Ow! Careful its hot. Ow! So Puddy wears a man fur? He was struttin around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson. And of course you find fur morally reprehensible. Eh anti-fur. I mean who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot. And this is the first youre seeing of the coat? We never dated in winter. You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer. Oh I walked by Bloomingdales the other day and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift. An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays Christmas its enough gifts. I would like one month off. Kramer said its a perfect gift. Thats what were gettin him. All right but were not buyin it at Bloomingdales. I will buy it you pay me back later. Ill sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense. Cheapness is not a sense. I cant stand Joe Mayos parties. You know the second you walk in hes got you workin for him. Hey can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice make sure we have enough? Uh... I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out. Hey. Hey. You got any pliers? What has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear? Hilarious. Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in. Why? To prevent an ambush. Yeah so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies. But then anyone can just look in and see you. Our policy is were comfortable with our bodies.

No Ill um Ill switch it back. No no no no. No thats all right. Well thats good. Because uh Newman and I-- Newman? He did this too? Well yeah. I deal with him. Hey look at this. This is the same massage chair were gettin for Joe Mayo $60 cheaper. Except the stores in Delaware. Ill have em overnight it. Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. Its more comfortable. It doesnt matter if its more comfortable. Its wrong. Why? Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain a plastic sleeve for your comb and a wallet for your money. But look at this thing. Its-its huge. You got more cow here than here. I need everything in there. Irish money? I might go there. Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free Save the Tiger poster. All right just gimme that.

Ill be with the hobos in the trainyard eating out of a bucket. Come on well go and talk to him and well straighten this thing out. Uh you uh you better put something on. George I am loving this no wallet thing. A man carries a wallet. You know the very fact that you oppose this makes me think Im onto something. Hey Jerry. Hey Joe Mayo. Nice place. Thanks. George can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions? Love to. Thanks. Jerry... Music? Actually can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass? But I could do that and the music. Oh no dont worry about the music. Just... have fun!

So were givin him nothing? No I brought a picture of the chair. Did you at least get him a card? I thought wed all sign the picture. Elaine... Hey Joe Mayo. I need you to be in charge of coats. Oh fantastic. And Puddy can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system? Sure thing Joe Mayo. Hi Im Jerry. How do you like my pants? Nice. (talking to George) Its working. (to the girl whos tapping on the aquarium) Dont tap on the glass. (answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayos apartment? (standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker. Goodbye Dr. Zaius. Why are we in Jerrys apartment? Well I uh I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah it has a more formal atmosphere you know with the shelves and the furniture. Make it quick Kramer my wife and I are about to go bowling. Oh well um Newman thinks that you uh evicted him? I did. I dont like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator. Look... Ive known Newman all my life in the building and youre all wrong about him. Hes a model tenant. Portly yes but smart as a whip. OK on your word he can stay. All right. But... Im gonna keep my eye on him. Well you wont regret it. Whats wrong? Elaine thanks for coming. Good working with you. All right lets hit the bricks. What? Hey I got a coat just like this! Oh. Uhhh... So Joe Mayo had the same coat. And you threw it out the window? Mm-hmm. God youre like a rock star. So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat. Because you threw it out. No because I was in charge of the coats. Its... insane. But you did actually throw his coat out the window. But he doesnt know that. As far as he knows somebody stole it and thats the person who should be responsible. But thats you. So I guess Ill have to buy him a new coat even though I dont think I should be held responsible which I am anyway. Well Im satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me. Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass. This...is an organizer a secretary and a friend. Look at you. Youre on a slant. Here just give me a couple of napkins. There there Im fine. What was that? I think I had some hard candy in there. No no this is supposed to go to Joe Mayos apartment. Ahhh. How does this thing work? Sir do you want me to deliver this to your friends place or not? Ahhhhh... Ready to go? All set. I cant believe Im going dancing. You dont go that often? No because its so stupid. Shall we? Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me? Compact lipstick all this? And can you help to carry my keys? What are you a medieval dungeon master? And a tin of altoids. Ow! Sharp key.

Look I stuck up for you. Man if he catches you were both out. Hey what is that up that tree? Hoooh! Man that looks like a dead bear. No thats a fur coat! Hey uh give me a boost. Man where did you learn to climb trees like that? The Pacific Northwest. So you had to carry some of Keris stuff. Big deal. You dont understand. I went on a successful pocket diet and I want to keep that weight off. You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you. Not more of that crap from the Titanic? No. No. Its a small mens carryall. Im not carrying a purse. Its not a purse. Its European. Oh. Hey did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet? I dont know. If Im gettin him a new fur Im not chippin in on a gift too. Yeah? Hey George did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet? Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God... What? Its in... transit. Did he get it? No. Mmm good. Tell him Im out. (hearing Elaine over the phone) What shes out? Well so what? Youre gettin a deal right? Well split it three ways. Allllll right! What is that noise? (hangs up the phone) Thats my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh! You know sometimes I get the feeling George isnt being completely honest with me. Hey. Oh uh yeah. Uh here are your pliers back....Weak hinge. Well I guess I better go and price fur coats. Oh go down to 88th Street. Theyre free. What are you talking about? Well theyre hanging from the trees. You know Newman found one there yesterday. Man that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur! 88th Street? Thats where Joe Mayo lives. Thats the coat! What was that pop sound? Well I had some hard candy in there. So to what do I owe this unusual invitation? Come in come in. Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece which seems oddly out of place. Please sit down. Newman um I wanted to talk to you about something. This isnt about my opening your mail? What? Because I dont never have anything I read was already open. Uh yeah uh no. Newman uh I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine and Id like to give it back to him. Sorry. Climbers keepers. You know Newmie. Um I know how you feel about me and I have to tell you Im quite flattered. You are? Oh yeah. I mean of all the men that I know youre the only one whos held down a steady job for several years. Well its-its interesting work I dont mind it. Ha ha ha ha. Dont you have a-a boyfriend? A uh burly athletic type? Uh dont worry hes cool. Cool? Very cool. So what do you say?

For I am in love with Svetlana and I dont care if the whole world knows except for Silvio who would throw me out of the apartment where I would be dancing on the sidewalk-- Thank you thank you thank you very much. Nice carryall. Its European. Do you still have my lipstick? Uh yeah I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah here it is. So that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties doesnt he? So what was your job? My job was to keep you away from the music. What he doesnt like my taste in music? Guess not. You shouldve been there last year. I got jiggy with it! Kramer! Its Silvio! Open up I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole. Hey Silvio! Look at this. Huh? Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he? Relax Silvio. No thats it. Youre both out of the building! Oh come on! Hey Newman didnt even give her that! No thats not even a womans coat. Its a mans! A mans? Yeah. What kind of a man would wear fur? Oh lots of em. Would you? No. Then who? What about Jerry? Jerry?

So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift? Whoa whoa. Now whos this Joe Mayo everyones talking about? Hes the guy were the buying the chair for remember? It was your suggestion. I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly it sounds made up. Oh so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself? No you dont have to buy anything. I already bought it! Ive been lyin to you for three days and now youre all screwin me! I dont understand. Why didnt you tell us you had it? I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked. Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it! Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair and it will be easy because the receipt is in my good friend.

George Janet looks very nice and shes quite a handsome woman. What does that mean? Yeah. What does that mean? (to Jerry) What do you mean by that? Enjoy. (she leaves) Elaine huh?.. Shes completely.. Oh! I know....Cos you dont think Janet?.. No.... Why would I... Its ludicrous.. Yes. For either one of us.. No... So... Exactly. Im not gay. ...neither am I. Kramer Kramer get in here. Wheres the crazy man Come on up. Come on in here. Haaaaaa!!! Whats happening? What you doing come and talk to us. Ive made an important life decision. Lets talk about that.

I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and thats exactly what Im going to do. Im never gonna talk again. Yeah right. What do I need to talk for.. ha! For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now Ive done all that.....Now its time for silence. Silence YES!! Kramer youre never gonna be able to completely stop talking. Jerry ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch. Well what does this mean? Well its Frank and Estelles reaction of hearing Georges man love towards she-Jerry. (frantic by now) SHUT UPSHUT UP SHUT UP...(then leaves) Thats the idea. Kramer theres no way you stick to this. (makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!! Oh! you just startin now? thats right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now. Ouch!!..........Now!! So J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog? Well were hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnierpeople wont be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one Oh! yeah... Thats a rather clever jab at inter office politics dont you think. Ahan Ahan....yeah...Euh but Why is it that the that the animals enjoy reading the email? Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesnt dissect gossamer. heh..hemm.. Well you dont have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny? Ha! Its merely a commentary on contemporary mores. (slides the magazine to her) But what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him) Its a slice of life. No it isnt. Pun? I dont think so. Vorshtein? Thats not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you? No. Then why did you print it. I liked the kitty. (gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think youre doing comedy. Actually thats not bad.. Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others Sally I cant believe youre already doing a One-woman show? No no.. Its just a little performance piece I wrote...

I run into this Jerry on the street and he says to me  Sally You stink You should give up acting. Oh! Im doing Jerry Now so youve got imagine I have ; horns a tail and hooks instead of feet. (big laughs from the audience and Kramer is cracking up) (to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!! She does a full hour about how youre the devil .I got to go see this thing. Good luck Its sold out for the next three weeks. Well I bet I can get in once I mention Im from ...The New Yorker. The New Yorker? Yes The New Yorker Ive met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE.... Wow! Good work Nancy Drew Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber. Nodding off... ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons. Wow! thats incredible......But you dont draw. I do to. What your sad little horsies the house with the little curl of smoke the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves) Its better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane. Where did you see that? Those are private!!! Jerry sorry Im late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isnt that great? Do you hate me? Nono I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil. Well...That is the title. I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it. You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but Ill tell you what Ill think... Its all a journey. You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater) Excuse me Miss Weaver OH! My god it is you! I.. Ive seen your show six times.. What a surprise. Aahh! Youre greatIts great Its so great to see a show thats (looks at Jerry) about something. Where to? (we hear him think) My friends are idiots she doesnt look like Jerry. She doesnt look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerrywhat does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because its a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesnt even look like Jerry.. You know I really do look like your friend Jerry. I know.... Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show. Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And hes like Hey stop doing your show. and Im like Hello! Its a free country. So then he goes. Okay Shmootsie and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. Hes getting you know Hands Across America. There really was shmootz on I didnt try to grab her ...And this is what he looks like when hes eating... Get Out of my House!!. Well boys I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon. Id stayed up all night Id fixed myself up a little before Id go out. That is not the point. some mouthwash a hat something. Just read it! (glances at it) Pretty good. Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? Its funny. Its a pig at a complain department. And hes saying  I wish I was taller ha ha. See? thats his complaint. I get it. Do you!!!.. because thats not a normal complaint. How bout if it was something like  I cant find my receipt my places a stye. Everything with you has to be so .. jokey. Im a comedian. I wish I was taller thats thats thats nice. thats real. Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks. Ill tell you who doesnt think it stinks The New Yorker. thats right. Theyre publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver. oh! thats it Im gonna put an end to this. The pig says my wife is a slut. Now thats a complaint. ...Hello Sally yeah this is JerryI just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and.. ....Im getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together. (from the back of the club leaving) Thats it Im calling in the big guns. To cease and desist on behalf of my client Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfelds Lawyer. Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld...(censored beep)...You How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I ve never gotten a cable special.....well thats it Im not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly. Check it out from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isnt it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it the pig wants to be taller and whats this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin..he he. Elaine Im afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire. Can I fix that after lunch sir? Oh! no right away chop chop........Oh! a new cartoon.....I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) Id like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves) (to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? Cause I wrote it. You shouldnt make fun of pigs. (he leaves) (returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much. Oh! Do tell sir? Its a Ziggy! A Ziggy? That irreverence that wit Id recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine to my archives. You know you know whats great about our relationship?...Its not about looks. Its not? No Cant be...For instance I remember when we first met we had a great conversation. I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party. ....But after that we really talked didnt we? Wellyou told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before. Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or Im in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened? You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus. Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough Ill take it. I like gum. I do too. you see thats what were about . You dont remind me of anyone and we love gum. I have gum in my hair. Im losin it (joining Kramer) Hey! Your Jerrys friend. Youre Goofy mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but its like Whoa!! take three steps back Get a life okay. but then there wouldnt be a Sally Weaver without the fans know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean theres Sally weaver the woman Sally Weaver the artist Sally Weaver the person... (loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...Im sorry I..I havent spoken in days. Well lay it on me string bean. Let me get this gum out of my hair and then Ill be ready for bed. OK Look the gum isnt cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please. George. Your hair? Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why dont you get undressed George. (George speeds out the door) George is in big trouble.... You ripped off a Ziggy? It mustve seeped up my subconscious Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....Dyou read the comics today? I see that Ziggys back at the complaint department.. The New Yorker is stealing my ideas. ha ha ha See thats funny.....cause its real. Hey look it ;Sallys cable shows on (Kramer turns around to leave) Hey! Kramer come on in. Youve got to watch this now shes got nothing. (on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me. Thats right sister. Why dont you just give up? Why are you yelling at the TV? ..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues.. Elaine have you been talking to her? Hey! Im just a fan..ha ha... Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone? (to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking?? ...All right ..Starting now...... You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short? like that (looking at Jerry) You mean like.. (points to his hair) ..That. So she.. Yes.. And you dont... Nooo... So... Exactly.. Hmmmm... We...must never ever speak of this again.. No no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie? Actually I think Im gonna take a few days off (starts to leave) I think thats for the best.]
166,9,14,[(clears throat) Maura I uh- I want you to know... I-Ive given this a lot of thought. Im sorry but... we uh we have to break up. No. (sips her drink) (double takes) Whats that? Were not breaking up. (takes another sip) (puzzled) W-were not? No. (hands George his cup) All right (he smiles weakly at Maura) She said no? She said no. What did you do? What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie! George both parties dont have to consent to a break-up. Its not like youre launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously you didnt make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments. Well I dont really like her. Thats good. I dont find her attractive. Solid. Id like to sleep with a LOT of other women. Always popular. Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food: Ooh Mr. Mashed Potatoes you are sooo goood. You have an airtight case! And in bed-- Im afraid were out of time. Hey. What? Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie Cinderfella. I got em at an auction. I got some cufflinks I couldve loaned you. No Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friars Club roast Im goin to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him. You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) Jerry! Oh thatll intrigue him. Well it worked when I met George Peppard last week. George Peppard has been dead for years. Well whoever he was he knew a lot about The A-Team! So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution? Right right. I mean if I was getting the chair Id go for something... hot and spicy you know... Thai maybe Mexican. Lethal injection feels like pasta... you know painless dont want anything too heavy... So um why dont we get together some time? Oh sure! Why dont you give me your number? I think itd be better if I called you. Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-? Mm mm... no not really. So is there anything you can tell me about yourself? (seductive tone) I think youre very beautiful. (flattered) Oh (laughs) Thatll do! (laughs some more) What about Puddy? I havent talked to him in like three weeks... I THINK it might be over... (unimpressed) So whats this guy about? I dont know. He wouldnt tell me his phone number where he worked... Ill bet hes in a relationship. Or hes a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine you could be dating the Green Lantern! Which one is he? Green suit power ring. I dont care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly) Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building. So you bought a cooler? No its a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables. And... what would those be? Some taxidermy thats been in my family for generations my Tony my... military discharge. (doubtful) You were in the Army? Y- B-briefly. Now I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound) Literally. (offended) Literally? Whats THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere? No go ahead. (stuttering gibberish gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy uh? Oh come on! Oh! Come on Jerry this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy you wouldnt last a DAY in the Army. (walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door) Well thats classified. Hey what if hes married? Kramer?! No the Green Lantern. (from inside) OK! So you would date a married guy? Thats so hacky. Well I dont know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get. (bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked! THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs) It was under a spoon! And so for all these reasons we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you (opens door) and good night. No George were not. (gestures towards book) But I proved it! I refuse to give up on this relationship. Its like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys. Well then I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key. (assertive) Im sorry George I cant do that. (shouting) Turn your key Maura. Turn your key! So how is a guy like you not involved? I might ask you the same thing. (in her mind) Thats true maybe hes not married. Oh that is so sweet. (in her mind cynical) How long do I have to hold this? (seeing a woman on the street) Oh no. Who is it? Um uh no one no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here uh let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on. (in her mind) Married. Thats it Im chucking the flower. (she does) (shouting up) Jerry! Jerry! Elaine what are you doin down there? You didnt hear me buzzing? Oh I guess its broken! Throw down your key. Its liable to bounce and go into a sewer. Ill catch it! Youll chicken out at the last second. ...Yeah youre right. Well will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out? (annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey you know whats weird? Huh? I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I cant anymore. Nodding off!... Well I was right. Hes an adulterer. And hes cheating on his wife with me! All right. Here! Im gonna try and fix the buzzer. (from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts) Hey... (re buzzer box) What are you doin? (waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom! (grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin for it didnt you? See you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. Youre so OBSESSED with me. Im gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving) Oo y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits) (in the hallway hearing the door lock behind him turns back) Kramer! (from inside) Security issue! Oh hey. You got in. Yeah flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers) (taking the menus) Oh thanks. (clattering inside) That wasnt me! So hes definitely married huh? Uh... Boy I would love to have been there when you told him off. Oh come on! Well he could be a superhero! You shouldve seen him run. (from inside Jerrys apartment) OK! (door opens) All right Jerry. Lets see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door) (from the street below Jerrys window) Jerry! (out of window) George the buzzers broken! Ill come down! (putting on his coat to go downstairs he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you. Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key) (opens the door for George) Where did you get that? (puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby) (barring the way) Im sorry. I-I dont know you. What? Theres been some robberies in the building. I-I cant let you in. But I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed and-and I forgot my key. Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar) (shakes his head) Im very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass) So I broke up with Maura. Its done. Im out. Great youre lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator) Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite) Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background still pressed against the glass aghast) (looking at the door) Hes starin at us. Dont look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door) We dont hear that. (They enter the elevator) Want a bite? Nooo I dont. (the elevator doors shut) (in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Cant dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it) (cheerily) Hey Honey. (she sweeps in shuts the door behind her and sits down) (still by the door) What? M-Maura what are you doin here? I ended this relationship... twice! George you didnt mean that. That was just a fight. Why does it always seem like Im the only one working at this break-up? George I listened to your arguments and they were rambling and flimsy. Im not convinced. Come on get dressed and lets get some dinner. (pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom) (picking up the apple) Eww Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot. (George freezes shakes his head and continues walking) So this is your little... love nest? (laughs) Its nothing special just a little place I keep. Oh. Ah should I light a fire? Oh that sounds... romantic. Im having a little problem with the heat. Um I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window) (in her mind anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (Theres a knock at the door) (leaning in) Can you get that please? Oh sure. Wheres Glenn? (guiltily) Ah... Youre the woman from the street and I am so sorry. You know Im not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear. Lady Im not his wife Im his welfare caseworker. Is he home? This is his home? Yes. So hes... (nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths oo) (coming back through the window carrying an old chair) I think this will burn! So you do live here. (sulkily) Yeah. (Jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut) You live on this floor? Yeah. (arriving at apartment sees Phil start to open his apartment door only one door down from Kramers) So you live right... there. Yeah. (enters his apartment) So I guess Ill s-- He wouldnt give me his number because he doesnt have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) Hes not married. Hes poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth) Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps? He probably busted it up and burned it for heat. So when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers? How can I end it over money? I feel bad. Well lets think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation? Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans. Good. How did you handle that? Well we gave him a few bucks and... now he goes in the alley across the street. Same situation. Pay him off and youre clean. Well I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do just walk into his hovel and hand him... well how much do you think it would be? (entering Monks) Hey. Hey where have you been? (sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt. If only he could have been cheating on his wife you know things would have been so much simpler. Whos this Blue Arrow? Green Lantern. We found out his super power was lack of money. (not amused) All right. Hes invulnerable to creditors. (annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing) Hes the Got-no-Green Lantern. Thank you. (gets up from her seat) Hey Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan. (leaning over to George) Ooh (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits) Hey maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura. Sure just tell Maura youre having an affair. Shes like a district attorney. If its not the truth Ill break under the cross. I actually have to do it. (fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?! Hey you know theres this secretary at work that always had a crush on me. Really? How come you never pursued her before? Shes too tanned. Its the middle of the winter shes like a carrot. (coming back into Monks) Did I leave my glasses here? (to Elaine still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce! (leaving again) Keep em! (George and Jerry savour the joke) Heh. Theres a giant parrot in the hallway. Its Phils. Who? Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway I told him itd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway. Whatd ya tell him that for? Because since youve been playing God with the front door Ive been tryin to smooth things out Jerry. In fact I was just hanging out at his place. Really? Whats it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch? Well I dont know but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phils... He let you? No he doesnt know. See I hid it without tellin him. So uh (starts walking towards door) Phil wont be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry) So you... you say youve been in the city all winter? I was in Maine for a couple days. (George looks puzzled at how shes so tanned) Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles) George Ive always fantasized about jumping into bed with you. (excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch) But... I dont want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon. (walking back) Are you sure? Cause it could really help me out of a jam. I want to build something with you George. Oh not more building. (sighs) And I wont take no for an answer. (she sits down) No? No. (after hesitating resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her) So uh what are we doing in this alley anyway? Its a surprise. (giggling) Oh. What are you doing? What is that? Its a bag of donuts. Its garbage. No no no no. When they make the new ones the old ones come out... right here. (has had enough) All right thats it. (rummaging in purse pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name? (still looking through the garbage bag) Its a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is. (writing out cheque) Ill make it out to cash. How bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty? (eating the bear claw) Oooh! Make it three hundred. (re the bear claw) You know Elaine youre the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece) (touched she takes it) Aw Glenn. Hi. Is Phil here? Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird which is lovely... by the way made a mess on my door. And? I thought maybe youd clean it up or your maid there. Thats my wife. (nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right I think were done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly) (in a tuxedo) So youre in a relationship with a woman you dont like and youre having an affair with a woman that wont have sex with you. This isnt going well. I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without em I have no in! You dont need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) Jerry! (heads for door grabbing his coat) Where are you goin? Help me look! (opening door) Its a big night. Im uh ice skating with one and going to a staged reading of Godspell with the other. Which is with who? (shaking his head weary) It doesnt matter. (he leaves) (entering Jerrys apartment in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah you clean up nice. I cant go until I find my cufflinks. Yeah see? I knew you would lose em. Thats why I took em out of your dresser drawer and put em in my strongbox. Youre a lifesaver. Would you get them please? Yeah well stop by Phils well pick up the key uh? Hey whats going on? Fredo is dead. (his wife sobs) That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator? No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door) Oh Phil... Mrs. Phil. Im so sorry. Oh Ill bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food. But I I didnt I-- Kramer they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird? Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy and he... puts it in the incinerator. Just get the key and lets get out of here. Yeah yeah. (goes to Phils door) You know its a... its a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredos food dish. Whoo! Thats a weeeird coincidence. Kramer!? (grabbing Kramers arm roughly pulling him back as hes about to knock) What? You killed Fredo! (high-pitched) Well Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldnt have eaten that key! Kramer I need those cufflinks but now theyre in the box and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do? You just answered your own question. (frowning in realization) Oh no! (nodding) Ill get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment as Jerry grimaces at the prospect) The uh actor that played Jesus made some odd choices. (shaking head confused) What? I mean uh... I had fun ice skating. Oh. (she smiles reassured and nods) George? Maura. (starts acting dramatically looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh my God! What are you doing here?! You told me to meet you here for lunch. (standing up still acting) Uhh! Im caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender) (calmly ignoring George) Im Maura. (shaking Lorettas hand and smiling) (to Maura also friendly) Im Loretta. You want to join us? (Maura nods and sits down next to her) (laughs hysterically gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well I understand if you never want to see me again so... (points towards door) George what we have is too important. We can work through this. So can we. (astounded) What? So this is still not over? No. You? No. All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them) Elaine wow a TV a stereo? Yeah and I got you a cord of wood so you wont have to burn em. Oh my God Alison. Youre home early. Who is this? (arms crossed angry) His wife. Youre... poor AND married? Looks like it. Who the hell are you? I guess Im... Lois Loan. Kramer I cant believe were grave robbers. (reading a tombstone) Mans best friend. Jerry I want something like that on my tombstone. (seeing Fredos tombstone) Oh my God. Here he is. I dont want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer) (sighs) All right then youre the one getting the key out of him. (grimaces and takes the shovel back) Ill dig. Listen I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. Im gonna go check it out. (hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well that was easy. All right Honey one last look then you have to let Fredo rest in peace. (with a wild expression) Hey Kramer! I dug Fredo up now lets cut him open! (horrified) Oh my God! (after a very awkward pause cheerily) Hey neighbor. All right. Im gonna try givin them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think? Give me forty youll never see me again. (to Jerry) So what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here or are you gonna move out or what? (still in tuxedo tie undone) Ah Ill just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building. So whats in the cooler? (flips open the lid) Oh. Well would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes Pop) I guess I forgot to lock it. You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing? Well this is one for the books huh Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!]
167,9,15,[When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) Whats that? Its a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. Im goin to Florida for his birthday. How much was it? Two hundred. But Ill tell him its fifty. He doesnt care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal. Where are you gettin a Wizard for fifty dollars? Ah Ill tell him I got it on the street and maybe its hot. Thats his favorite. I got a message from the Rosses at work today. Susans parents? Whens the last time you talked to them? At the funeral give or take. You know deep down I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susans death. Why because you picked out the poision envelopes?

Radar detector? Ive never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. Youre like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. Its a Wizard organizer. This looks like too much money. Nah I got it from a guy on the street. It was like fifty bucks. You think its hot? Could be. Attaboy! Helen Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer! Im right here. And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail fax theres a calculator. So I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip? Yeah I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner. Helen we got into restaurants and figure out the tips. Jerry youre getting your father too excited. (entering the condo and going to the fridge as if hes a neighbor) Hey buddy. Whend you get here? Kramer what are you doing here? I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door. Mr. Kornstein died and its a beautiful apartment. Yeah your uh folks said it was for rent so I jumped on it. Kramer you cant live down here. This is where people come to die. (getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people. Dont eat cookies for breakfast! Ill fix you something. How bout a feta cheese omelette? Mmmm that sounds great Mom. If you feed him hell never leave. We dont have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters? (immaturely) I guess. I cant believe this. I know I know. Dont I look more relaxed? So George do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation? Actually I did have a thought. Oh. Why dont you just ask him? (rudely and giving him a duh look) Because if I ask him then its like I really want to know. Maybe hes um... mixed. Is that the right word? I really dont think were supposed to be talkin about this. Yeah. (standing up) Im just gonna go to the bathroom. (starting to leave) You know what Im leavin. Yeah. Ill just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monks) Oh. Mrs. Ross Mr. Ross. Oh youre Georges friend. We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh what happened to his place in the Hamptons? (laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I uh... I dont think so. Have a good one. Rosses. George we were just talking about you. Well sorry I missed that uh charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about. Really? Yeah I may move out there. (getting yeah right glances from the Rosses) I mean it Ill do it! OK Ill see ya later. Keep it real! (eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal and now for my Wizard tip calculator. Dad its got lots of other functions. Dont worry. Ill get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I cant get it open. Yay! Jerry got it open. The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound? (looking at the Wizard) Well your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents. Well round down. Jerry it was so nice of you to come down here on your fathers birthday. Youve helped take his mind off the condo elections. Oh right. You cant run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo. I was never impeached! I resigned! Even so the press would bury him! What press? The condo newsletter the Boca Breeze. Pinko Commie rag. (coming up to the three Seinfelds) Hey Morty. Your boy here he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor. Shes fifty. You know what hes got? Hes got charisma. Thats my man. All right Ill see you guys. Yeah. Yeah. (taping Mortys glasses) Morty whatre you lookin at? Ill tell you what Im looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista Phase Three. Hmm. Elaine thank you for the Wizard! Wow its got so many functions. Yeah yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name we know that. Uh hobbies. Skiing racquetball... Well I dont do that stuff. It doesnt matter it doesnt matter it doesnt matter. Um. Oh heres one: race. Isnt that optional? It certainly should be. Its nobodys damn business! But they really would like to know. All right Im... Asian. What? Just to mess with em. laughing awkwardly: Oh. Right. Good one. Average income uh... over a hundred thousand. Really? Does that matter? No but... it is very nice to know. (in his parents condo on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryls... you know. (in Jerrys apartment) Ah Ive given up. So now were going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure thatll cover us either way. (as Kramer walks by) Youre a master of race relations. Hey so Kramers running for president of the condo? Yeah its all my fathers doing. He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse. Oh heh heh heh. Who are they running against? Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair. (entering Jerrys apartment) Jerry? (to George) Hes still down with his folks. (to Elaine) What are you doin here? (overhearing the other two: Elaine Elaine-- (to George) Im gettin his mail. (overhearing the other two) Oh no. (to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail? (to George) Mm-hmm. (taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry why is Elaine getting your mail? George listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets dont dry out and leak. (trying to understand what theyre talking about) What? What about the mail? This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets George. (hanging up) All right Jerry. Ill do it. See ya. So I ran into the Rosses again. Oh right at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons? From me. What did you say? I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say? I told them you didnt. And I laughed and I laughed. So they knew? Those liars! But you lied first. Yeah but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons they never said a thing! You dont let somebody lie when they know youre lying. You call them a liar! Like youre a liar! Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard? So this is over not over? Im bettin not over. Hmm-hmm not by a long shot. Im calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then well see who blinks first. Havent you done enough to these people? This is not about them. Now if youll excuse me I have to exercise Jerrys gaskets. (to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. Im running for condo president. Id like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember maam a vote for me is a vote for Kramer. Will you cut my meat? Gladly. (to Darryl) Coffee? Sure. (to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream. Im black. (re-thinking) Oh you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that? What? God there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple. Interracial? Us? Isnt that unbelievable!? Yes its awful! Theyre upset because were an interracial couple. That is racism! I dont feel like eating. Me neither. Well maybe this turkey club. So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons. Sounds grand. Do you have your bathing suits? Its March. Speak now or we are headed to the Hamptons. Its a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right you wanna get nuts? Come on. Lets get nuts! (in his parents condo to his father whos in another room) Hey Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad you look so different. Oh no. Were campaigning Jerry. To rule the people one... must walk among them. (coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrows the election! Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner three oclock. But then when we win the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m. You know you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner. Daily what? (coming into the condo) Have you read todays Boca Breeze? (looking at the newsletter) Hey look at that. Picture of me huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse. Barefoot in the clubhouse? Dont you realize this is against the rules. Well I couldnt find my shoes. Kramer these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here sit in the heat pretend its not hot and enforce these rules. Who wants hot chocolate? Oh yeah! Me. This is a huge scandal! We need damage control. All right look. People seem to like those tip calculators huh? Wizards! Yeah well how bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board. Kramer... There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal. Payoffs. Now were playin politics. All right what do we next Morty huh? Wiretaps slush funds?

Oh look an antique stand. Pull over. Well buy you a housewarming gift. (chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right were taking it up a notch! (handing Elaine a menu) Here you go. (to the black waitress) Long day? Yeah I just worked a triple shift. I hear ya Sister. Sister? (as Darryl comes into Monks) Yeah. Its OK. My boyfriends black. Here he is. See? Hi Elaine. Hey. Hes black? Yeah. Im black? Arent you? (leaving) Ill give you a couple minutes to decide. What are you talking about? Youre black. You said we were an interracial couple. We are. Because youre Hispanic. I am? Arent you? No. Why would you think that? Your names Benes your hair and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants. Thats because I thought you were black. Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because Im black? I dont think we should be talking about this. So what are you? Im white. So were just a couple of white people? I guess. Oh. Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap? (leaving with Elaine) Sure. (having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think weve got this baby all sewn up huh? Oh uh there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman he wont be leavin any tips where he is. Aw. Congratulations Mr. President. Congratulations Mr. Puppet Master. Hey Morty whats wrong with these tip calculators? What are you talking about? Its overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT. This isnt a Wizard its a Willard. A Willard? Saccamano Sr. screwed me! Jerry why didnt you get them Wizards? Because a real Wizards two hundred dollars. You didnt have a deal? No deal. Not hot. Morty you and Kramer youre finished. What? Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair. (getting up to leave) Well the people have spoken. Well thats it for me. Im Im headin back to New York. Dad Im sorry. You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?! It does other things! Where are we George? Almost there. Well this is the end of Long Island. Wheres your house? We uh we go on foot from here. All right. Theres no house! Its a lie! Theres no solarium. Theres no Prickly Pete. Theres no other solarium. We know. Then why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didnt you say something? Why? Why? Why? We dont like you George. And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan. Oh. All right! Lets head back.]
168,9,16,[Alright be careful with the car babe. Yeah yeah. And dont move the seat I got it right where I like it. Goodbye? Two and ten babe. Okay. Dont peel out. I wont. Jesus? According to our latest quarterly thingKruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts? Well I know when Im a little strapped I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time. Works for me. Good thinking George. Or we dont even send the check and then when they call we pretend were the cleaning service. Heh heh. Hello? I sorry no here Kruger. Are you done? Silly voices cmon people lets get real. I had em Jerry. They loved me. And then? I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end its buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns. Showmanship George. When you hit that high note you say goodnight and walk off. I cant just leave. Thats the way they do it in Vegas. You never played Vegas. I hear things. Heres one. I borrowed Puddys car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations. I like Christian rock. Its very positive. Its not like those real musicians who think theyre so cool and hip. So you think that Puddy actually believes in something? Its a used car he probably never changed the presets. Yes he is lazy. Plus he probably doesnt even know how to program the buttons. Yes he is dumb. So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious? Dumb and lazy I understand. Tell you how you could check. How? Reprogram all the buttons see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo. No no the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other persons. No its doing the same thing to someone that they did to you. Yeah Elaines gonna do the same thing to Puddys radio that the radio did to her. Well thats the gist of it! Quiet! So where is this Sophie? Oh shes picking me up in a few minutes. How long have you two been together? I dunno. Since the last one. Oh here she is. You wanna meet her? Nah. By the way how did Puddy get back in the picture? I needed to move a bureau. Hey Jerry you got any pepper? Hey Jerry. Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker. Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that something like that. Aah-choo. A little wetter. See I didnt believe it. Whats with the fake sneezing? Yeah were going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing. They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. Its an easy gig. Do medical schools actually do this? Well the better ones. Alright lets practice retching. HUAAHHH!! I think the phone is ringing. HUAAHHH!! Would you hold it a second?! Thank you will you get out of here with that stuff? Mickey DTs. Hello? Hey. Its me. Elaine? No its me. George?? Jerry its Sophie. I cant believe you dont recognize my voice. Oh I knew it was you I was joking. Im a comedian. You got any Ipecac? Ipecac? Kramer I really think you guys are going too far with this. No Mickey he swallowed twelve aspirin. Did he overdose? No its just too much. ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball and that spells trouble. Alright well why dont we smooth the head down to nothing stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane? (getting up and leaving) Alright! Thats it for me. Goodnight everybody. In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit. Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot! Gonorrhea? You wanna trade? Sorry buddy this is the Hamlet of diseases. Severe pain nausea delusions its got everything. Sure. Okay what do you got? The surgeon left a sponge inside me. Good luck with that. I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone. What did you do the rest of the day? I saw Titanic. So that old woman shes just a liar right? And a bit of a tramp if you ask me. Hello boys. Hey so did you give that radio the old switcheroo? I did. And the Christian rock? Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper a Jesus fish! Jerry do you have any fishsticks? No. So youre disappointed hes a spiritual person? Well yeah I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional I feel misled. I think its neat. You dont hear that much about god anymore. I hear things. Hey so Sophie gave me the Its me on the phone today. Its me? Isnt it a little premature? I thought so. Hah. Shes not a me. Im a me. Im against all its mes. So self-absorbed and egotistical its like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes! Well I got gonorrhea. That seems about right. Thats what they gave me. They? The Government? No no. Hes pretending hes got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it. And its a waste of my talent. Its just a little burning. Mickey he got bacterial meningitis. I guess there are no small diseases only small actors. (leaving) Alright thats it for me. Good night everybody. What was that? Showmanship George is trying to get out on a high note. See showmanship. Maybe thats what my gonorrhea is missing. Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row. Yes yes I will! Im gonna make people feel my gonorrhea and feel the gonorrhea themselves. Just a little burning during urination. The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I a customer and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh I pursued and she withdrew then she pursued and I withdrew and so we danced. I burned for her much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards. Gonorrhea! One message. Hope its not from you. Hey Jerry its me. Call me back. Sophie. Shes still doing that? Yep. Alright Ill tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the its me heh? Pull the old switcheroo. I think thats a whats good for the goose is good for the gander. What the hell is a gander anyway? (picking up the phone and dialing) Its a goose thats had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie its me. Hey Raef. (to George) She thinks its someone named Raef. Good let her think it. (into the phone with a disguised voice) So whats going on? Not a lot. Ask about you ask about you. So uh how are things with Jerry? Oh I really like him but well I still havent told him the tractor story. Right right the tractor story. Are you sick Raef? You sound kinda funny. I sound funny? Abort! Abort! Yeah I better get to a doctor bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that? That was very real. She said theres some tractor story that she hasnt told me about. Woah back it up back it up. Beep beep beep. Tractor story? Beep beep beep? What are you doing? So where do you wanna eat? Feels like an Arbys night. Arbys. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god? Yes. Oh. So youre pretty religious? Thats right. So is it a problem that Im not really religious? Not for me. Why not? Im not the one going to hell. You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor. No ones stealing a tractor its a five-mile-an-hour getaway. Were dancing around the obvious its gotta be disfigurement. Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need? No she looks completely normal. Oh. Okay here it is I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day. You think shes got toes for thumbs? Hows her handshake? A little firm isnt it? Maybe a little too firm? I dont know. Hands a little smelly? Why do I seek your counsel? Well Im going to hell. That seems about right. According to Puddy. Hey have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and-- Im not in the mood. (To a passing waitress) Ill have some coffee and a doughnut. What do you care? You dont believe in hell. I know but he does. So its more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul. Well relationships are very important to me. Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity. (to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devils food cake. Hey. Where is everyone? Theyre all off the project. They were boring. George you are my main man. I am? I dont know what it is I cant put my finger on it but lately you have just seemed on. And you always leave me wanting more. This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders. Ah Im not too worried about it. Lets get started. Okay. George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around no feet. And? All me. Alright and here are you ailments for this week. By the way Mr. Kramer you were excellent. Oh thank you. Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get? Gonorrhea? Excuse me I think theres been a mistake see I had gonorrhea last week. Oh its no mistake. We loved what you did with it. I dont believe this Im being typecast. I move my knight... here. Check. They should update these pieces nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor. Jerry are you embarrassed that youre losing? Losing? You know yesterday I lost control of my car almost bought the farm. Bought the farm? Tractor! This is an odd side of you Jerry. I feel uncomfortable. Wait dont go. Lets thumb wrestle. A scar? A big long scar where her leg would dangle when shes riding a...? A tractor. Im sure shes a little self-conscious and doesnt like to talk about it. I dont see whys she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs. She doesnt have toe thumbs. Well if she keeps horsing around with that tractor-- Alright. So hows the two-man operation at Kruger? Two-man? Its all me. Kruger doesnt do anything; Disappears for hours at a time gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh I dont believe this. This is what I have to put up with Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who? Im not too worried about it. Well I am. Couldnt you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox? Alright alright Im going. (to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this? Never. Elaine they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why dont you just grab that one. Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy thats his. Cmon get it. Well if you want it you get it. Sorry thou shalt not steal. Oh but its ok for me? What do you care you know where youre going. Alright that is it! I cant live like this. Nah. Cmon. Alright what did I do? David Im going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god the heat! I mean what do you think about all that? Gonna be rough. Uh you should be trying to save me! Dont boss me! This is why youre going to hell. I am not going to hell and if you think Im going to hell you should care that Im going to hell even though I am not. You stole my Jesus fish didnt you? Yeah thats right! Oh my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle? Mr. Kramer? Youre up. Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea arent you? Well well see. (pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam and this was the only friend I had left. Hey! Thats my cirrhosis! Hes stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? Ill make you sick. Let me see if I understand this. Youre concerned that he isnt concerned that youre going to hell. And you feel that shes too bossy. Yeah thats right. Well oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages couples have difficulty-- You arent? No. Were just you know having a good time. Oh well then its simple. Youre both going to hell. No way this is bogus man! Well thank you father. Oh did you hear the one about the new guy in hell whos talkng to the devil by the coffee machine? Im really not in the mood Im going to hell. Oh lighten up. Itll only feel like an eternity. You know Jerry theres this thing that I havent told you about. See there was this tractor and oh boy this is really difficult. Sophie its me. I know about the tractor story and Im fine with it. How could you know? (putting his finger to Sophies lips then to his own then back to Sopies) Shh. Shh. Shh. Its not important. Whats important is Im not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship. ...I didnt say that no. You gave me gonorrhea you didnt even tell me! Well Im sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought youd have fun with it. Hey hey! Im with someone. Oh. Hello. No I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner whos supportive. (to Mickey) You know? Shes right. Unfortunately I didnt have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor. You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story?? You cant get it from that. But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit. (walking out) Alright thats it for me. Youve been great. Goodnight everybody. Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!? You seem like youve got a pretty good handle on it. No! I dont! Dont you even care? This is your company! Its your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which the R fell off and all it says now is K-uger! K-uger that sounds like one of those old-time car horns huh? K-uger! K-uger! Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much Mr. Kruger! Too much! (getting up to leave) Thank you George youve been great. Thats it for me. Oh no youre not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger! Its K-uger! No! No! Goodnight everybody!]
169,9,17,[I read somewhere that this Brentanos is the place to meet girls in New York. First it was the health club then the supermarket now the bookstore.

As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua New Guinea once said (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Whos dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright Ill just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed) Hi Im Zach. Hi Im miserable. (They both laugh) Excuse me Sir. What are you doing? (Acting innocent) Im all set. (Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom? (Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear? They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you if it wasnt for the toilet there would be no books. (Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.

Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down! (Rubbing it in) Ah the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything? (Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position? (Confused) Whats your position? I am an associate. Hey me too. Yeah me too. Oh God. Why did I do this? Now Im the office skank. Well unless you tell everybody youre dating. (Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if were dating what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers. (Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling. (Sarcastic) Oh bravo. (Sarcastic) Oh hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches? (Taking his offer seriously) No weve already eaten. (Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way. Jerry check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well were gonna make it happen! (Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No youre not. Newman he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office.. (Still skeptical) No he doesnt. Hes shipping us a rickshaw. It cant miss! Yes it can. Well start out with one and they when it catches on were gonna have a whole fleet! Its the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine. So whos gonna pull this thing? (To Newman) Well I just assumed you would. Yeah but I though- (Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no. (Extremely happy about Kramer and Newmans dilemma) My isnt this an awkward moment? (Brainstorming) What about the homeless? Cant we worry about them later? (Explaining) To pull the rickshaw. (Pondering Kramers plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street.. Theyre always walkin around the city. Why not just strap something to them?! (Sarcastic) Now thats the first sensible idea Ive heard all day. Jerry hello! (Sits down) So Leo hows everything? You doin Okay? I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone. (Shrugging his problems off) Yeah yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little? What are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But Im not. (Being frank) Leo I saw you in Brentanos yesterday. Why didnt ya say hello? Because you were too busy stealing a book. (Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello. (Showing that its a problem) Leo I saw you steal. Oh they dont care. We all do it. Who criminals? Senior citizens. No big deal. You could get arrested. Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) Im an old man. Im confused! I thought I paid for it. Whats my name? Will you take me home? (Pleading) Leo.. Alright alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point. (Thinking hes stopped Leos thefts) Thank you. (Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?! (Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. Whatd you think I was the office skank? Well.. Well? Weve been dating for three months. Between you and me and.. anyone else you want to tell. (Exits closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh.. (Pointing at the closed door) Isnt that Zach? Yeah. Arent you upset? (Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh man! Oh! Alright listen up. Now you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now what were looking for are motivated hard-working homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off walking away) Now I dont caer where youre from or how you got here or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit. The government! (Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. Youre also going to need a well-toned upper body. Alright whos first? Hey. Name please. Rusty. (Writing on a clipboard) Rusty. (To Rusty) You know I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence. (To Rusty) Alright uh take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn and bring her back. Lets see what youve got! Ok? Ready and go! (Watching Rustys pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form. (Yelling out to Rusty) Alright pace yourself Cause youre gonna have to do this all day for very little money. Hey whats he doin? I think he stealing our rickshaw! Well then hes out! Yes I uh I need to return this book. (Puts the books code into the computer) Im sorry we cant take this book back. Why not? Its been flagged. (Confused) Flagged? Its been in the bathroom. It says that on the computer? Please take it home. We dont want it near the other books. (Outraged. Leaving) Well you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read! (To himself) I dont believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncles having a little problem with shoplifting.. Mm-hmm. Wheres your uncle? (Pointing) Hes over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know set him straight.. (Into his walkie-talkie) We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond. 51-50? That - thats just a scare right? Sir Im gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. (The Guard rushes tward Uncle Leo) Swarm! Swarm! What?! Im an old man! Im confused! Youre under arrest. (To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him. Jerry you ratted me out?! (Unsure of what to say - he remembers Leos courtesy tip) Hello? Hello. Mom I didnt rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight. Jerry he wont last a day in prison. (Scoffing) Prison. Im sure its just a fine. Shes got priors. (Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo? It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone. Besides its not stealing if its something you need. (Confused) What does that mean? Nobody pays for everyting. (Shocked at his parents) Youre stealing too?! Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well they wear out so quick. Mom you too? Sometimes your father forgets so I have to steal them. Alright Ill talk to you later. (While washing his hands in Jerrys kithen sink) Well the rickshaws gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise) he bolted. (Joking around) Well you know eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months. (To Newman) See we shouldve gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans or.. his other bag of cans. We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. Ill hit the soup kitchens bakeries and smorgasbords. To the Idiotmobile! So even though youre not really going out with this guy hes cheating on you? That is correct. But heres the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody Im dumping his sorry ass and Im the office- (Butting in) Tina Turner? (Accepting) Alright. Well Ive to every Brentanos. This things flagged in every database in town! Is it so horrible to have to keep a book? I dont understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants. (Stern on George) Not underpants. Hey thats your Uncle Leo. (Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello! (Bitter) Jerry. (Trying to explain) Uncle Leo Im sorry. I didnt know about your.. past. (Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me I never forget! (Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo wait! Hello?! French impressionism. Oh I love this. (Looking up at George) Now what is the problem with this book? Nothing. How much do you want for it? You know I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five. Leos furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at Georges book) What is that doing on the table? (Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry simmer down. (Pointing) Im not eating anything in the vicinity of that book. (Confused) What is wrong with this book? Simmer! That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and- (Cutting Jerry off she stands up trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands) (The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask what do you read in the bathroom? I dont read in the bathroom. Well arent you something? Elaine do you have a moment? Its about your lover. (Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room. Elaine who among us hasnt snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton? (Confused) Love newton? Im afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. Hes back on the horse Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinamans nightcap. An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well it just keeps getting better! And in a tiny way I almost feel responsible. Im the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel. Look uh Mr. Peterman the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me! Damn it Elaine. That wasnt Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side. Oh. Well you know I had planned to uh- (Cutting her off) No buts Elaine. Or I will strip you of your associate status. (Goes to leave) Uh P.S. the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho. It was a crime of passion. If anyone betrays me I never forget. He wont last a day in prison. (Leo has Jerry written on the fingers his right hand and Hello written on his left. Hes doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right yelling out) Answer that damn phone! Hello? Hey its me. Uncle Leo? (Sarcastic) Oh thats nice. What are you up to? Nightmares. You? My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals. (Yelling out from off-camera) Im burning up! Elaine! Eat your soup! Youre not feeding him are you? Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go thats it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go. Hey buddy. (Scared) Ah! Kramer! I thought I heard you. Get out of here! (From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerrys bedroom) There you are. Will everybody please leave?! I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park. Our rickshaw? Its entirely possible. I want everyone out! (Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Lets talk in Jerrys kitchen. Ill make some cocoa. (To Jerry) Good night. (Bitter) Good night Newman. There it is! Rusty! Oh there you are. Oh do I get the job? (Sarcastic) Yeah yeah. Well get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Lets get this baby home. Uh.. What? You know when you think about it its kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean after all it is a conveyance. Yes thats true. So which one of us is gonna pull? Well theres only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot two spot zig zag tear pop-die pennygot tennyum tear harum scare em rip em tear em tay taw toe.. (Realizing he won) Yeah. Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot two spot.. Hey boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling! (Gesturing tward the book) So you want to donate this to charity? Well I assume theres some sort of write-off. Whats the value of the book? Uh about two hundred dollars Miss DeMooney. (Correcting. Stern) Its DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay. Oh. (Opens the cover of the book) Oh wait a second. (Certain) This book has been in the bathroom. (Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - thats rediculous. Its been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentanos. Mister were trying to help the homeless heare - its bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap em to a rickshaw! (Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright I Ill just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal? Yeah and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here and I wont jump over this counter and punch you in the brain! I could take it in merchandise.. (Threatening to hit him) Here I come.. So this bookll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere? Yeah. Great. (To Elaine) So the worst is over? Yeah. Now I can break up with him. Hes clean and Im the office hero. Seems like youre better at fake relationships than real ones. Yeah huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho. (Leaving Jerry) See ya. (To cashier) Id like to speak with the manager please. Mind your pace Boy. Chop chop! (Tired) Oh I cant go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest) Well dont tarry. Im behind schedule as it is. (Stretching) Oh.. (Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer! Woah! Wait! Ahhh! Yaaaahhh! (Optimistic) Well this is the first day of the rest of my life! Waaaaahhhh! George? What are you doin here? I cant sell the book. Its been marked. (Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has. So Im gonna steal another one and then return it. That way everything is even. (Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book steal another ask for your money back - and to you thats even? Im goin in! Did you want to speak with the manager? Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day.. Yes Uncle Leo. I remember him. Im sorry our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters. (Pleading) Oh come on. Hes just a lonely old man. All old people steal. Thats right. Thats why we stopped carrying batteries. Look Ill be honest with you weve had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone. So it could be anyone? I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act. That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm! No! Jerry!]

172,9,20,[Man Im starving. How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game? Because ballpark food doesnt count as real food. Right. Its just an activity. Its like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band. You know my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that people would just hit the ball and it would fly away. I cant believe you all made me leave before the end of the game. Oh come on Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked. Those nachos are killing me. I thought you were hungry. Its complicated. Come on Jerry youre going to miss the exit. Keep your shirt on. I got it. Watch out for that maroon Golf. Oh boy. Look at this guy. Hes trying to box me out. Ill tell you when you can go. Wait wait wait Wait-- now now now. No no no. Go go! No no. Wait-- now now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh... Oh calm down maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated. You want me to moon him? Ooh lets moon him. Roll up your window. Lets do a pressed ham under glass. Oh no I couldnt do that. Look at this look at this. Hes giving us the finger. Oh all right. Yeah. So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg. Oh yeah. Whats that called? Blimp: The Hindenburg Story. How was it? I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes? Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it. Anyway right in the middle the ship blows up-- burning debris bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield I yelled out Thats gotta hurt! Heh. The place went nuts. Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if youd yelled that out at the actual disaster. Yeah. Why are we slowing down? What is that music? Whats with all these flags? Oh no. Its the Puerto Rican Day parade! Ohh! Oh the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. Were never getting home. All right. Im gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico. Puerto Rican Day parade.] Yeah...uhh...well the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here. Well it is our day. Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry. And the Mets score two in the eighth inning. See? If we had stayed we could have seen those runs. I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos. Im going to miss 60 Minutes. You know I hate to miss 60 Minutes. Its part of my Sunday weekend wind-down. I dont know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious. All right gentlemen I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there. But thats a one-way street coming this way. Besides how am I gonna get all the way over there? Just inch over. You worm your way. Just do it Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. Im gonna throw up. You know you should make yourself throw up. Huh? You know youre going to. All right Im worming. Hey Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera. Theyre not letting me in. My hand is out. Well I think were gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face. You sure you want his face? No no no. It was Mar&iacute;a Conchita Alonso. This guys giving me the stare-ahead. The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.

Well thats rude. Can you believe her? Yeah. Ill see you later. Where are you going? The movies. Blimp is playing right there. Youre going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?

This traffics a killer aint it? You want to get outta here? Heres what we do. We leave the car here we take the plates off we scratch the serial number off the engine block and we walk away. Walk away? Youve got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen and then you get another one free. Isnt there a deductible? All right what is your deductible? I dont know. Yes because theyve already deducted it. From what? The car which were leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money if there is any and you get a new car. Were not leaving the car! All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company youll have to work this out with maroon Golf. Absolutely not. He sped up. Swung on line hard toward left center field. Thats in the gap thats a base hit. Im ready to talk. Thats gotta hurt! Its...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh! Damn you laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! Youre just a prop comic! Wheres the craft?! Ok heres the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an I am sorry wave. Whats that?

And by the way that was an Im not sorry wave. What was that? Im glad I cut you off because black Saab rules! So long jackass! Elaine?! Jerry?! Jackass? So Im a jackass now?
