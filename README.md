# TextMiningSeinfeld
Using Seinfeld scripts and IMDb ratings to find relationship between text and audience response

## Descriptions
This project explores the idea that we can predict the rating and viewership of an episode using only the text of the episode. We use the information learned from [UVa's topsics course in Text Mining](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/Course/CS6501-Text-Mining/_site/).
